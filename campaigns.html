Some of these encounters are no more than brutal skirmishes, fought for territory or plunder. Others are calculated steps in a greater plan, a campaign of dominance designed to draw the eye of the Everchosen himself.</p></blockquote> <h2 id="embarking-upon-a-campaign"><a href="#embarking-upon-a-campaign" class="header-anchor">#</a> EMBARKING UPON A CAMPAIGN</h2> <p>To play through a campaign, you will first need to choose a campaign quest and fill out a warband roster for your warband. Once you have done so, you are ready to challenge any opponent to a campaign battle.</p> <p>In Warcry, the campaign quest you choose for your warband is unique to you, and charts the progress of your warband only. This means you can challenge any opponent to a campaign battle, so long as they too have chosen a campaign quest and filled out a warband roster.</p> <p>Some players may be part of a group of players that decide to all embark upon a Warcry campaign at the same time, and to only challenge those within their group to campaign battles. Other players might play a different opponent each week at their local club or games store. There is no right or wrong way to play through your campaign, and the rules presented here are flexible to cater to the needs of the individual player.</p> <h2 id="campaign-quests"><a href="#campaign-quests" class="header-anchor">#</a> CAMPAIGN QUESTS</h2> <p>At the heart of every Warcry campaign is the quest your warband is striving to achieve. This is referred to as a campaign quest. You can find a whole array of different campaign quests to choose from in the campaign section of this book (pg 82-127). Additional campaign quests can also be found at warcry.com and in White Dwarf.</p> <p>Each campaign quest has one or more faction runemarks to denote which warbands can embark upon it. The campaign quests in the campaign section have a single faction runemark, and so choosing a campaign quest often goes hand- in-hand with choosing which warband you wish to play through the campaign with. In addition, each campaign quest contains the following:</p> <h3 id="_1-territory-rules"><a href="#_1-territory-rules" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1. TERRITORY RULES</h3> <p>Each campaign quest has its own territory rules that enable your warband to dominate areas within the Eightpoints. For the aspiring followers of the Dark Gods, these territory rules allow your warband to raise sinister monoliths and enslave chaotic beasts as thralls. For other warbands, such as the Stormcast Eternals, the territory rules will allow your warband to purge the chaotic taint from the lands and create areas of hallowed ground. The territory rules for each campaign quest are detailed in full upon it.</p> <h3 id="_2-artefacts-of-power-and-command-traits-tables"><a href="#_2-artefacts-of-power-and-command-traits-tables" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. ARTEFACTS OF POWER AND COMMAND TRAITS TABLES</h3> <p>Each campaign quest has 1 table of artefacts of power and 1 table of command traits. As your warband progresses you will be awarded items from these lists at certain points; this is explained in the aftermath sequence (pg 66-70).</p> <h2 id="warband-roster"><a href="#warband-roster" class="header-anchor">#</a> WARBAND ROSTER</h2> <p>After choosing a campaign quest, you will need to fill out a warband roster (pg 160). First, note down the campaign quest you have chosen, then fill in the other areas of player and warband information such as your warband’s name (you can draw inspiration from the many warbands mentioned in this book and others).</p> <p>The warband roster has space for 1 leader/favoured warrior and 10 fighters. For a full 20-strong warband you will need two copies of this page.</p> <h3 id="adding-fighters"><a href="#adding-fighters" class="header-anchor">#</a> ADDING FIGHTERS</h3> <p>The next step in completing your warband roster is to add fighters to it. Your warband roster is the pool of fighters from which you will pick up to 15 when mustering your warband for a campaign battle (see Playing a Campaign Battle, pg 65).</p> <p>Before your first campaign battle, you can add up to 20 fighters to your warband roster. These fighters can total any number of points, but it should contain at least 1000 points’ worth of fighters to allow you to field a full warband during your first campaign battle. You do not have to add the full 20 fighters to begin with – you can instead choose to add additional fighters as the campaign progresses. You’ll be able to add and remove fighters from your warband roster after each campaign battle (pg 67). When adding fighters to your warband roster, you must adhere to the following restrictions:</p> <ol><li>Your warband roster must include at least 3 fighters.</li> <li>Your warband roster cannot exceed 20 fighters.</li> <li>All fighters added to your warband roster must share the same faction runemark as the campaign quest you have chosen.</li> <li>Your warband roster must include 1 fighter with the</li> <li>Leader runemark ( ) and cannot include more than 1 fighter with the Leader runemark ( ).</li></ol> <p>On pages 134-151 you can find background tables to help you personalise all the fighters in your warband.</p> <h3 id="campaign-progress-tracker"><a href="#campaign-progress-tracker" class="header-anchor">#</a> CAMPAIGN PROGRESS TRACKER</h3> <p>The warband roster includes a campaign progress tracker. This tracks how close your warband is to completing the goal of their quest. There are 12 points on the campaign tracker referred to as map points. Your warband begins on the map point labelled ‘Start’. You can indicate the progress of your warband by marking the map point they have reached. You can find the rules for advancing map points on page 70.</p> <h2 id="preparing-for-your-first-campaign-battle"><a href="#preparing-for-your-first-campaign-battle" class="header-anchor">#</a> PREPARING FOR YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN BATTLE</h2> <p>When first filling out your warband roster, you can ignore the Lesser Artefacts, Artefacts of Power, Command Traits, Destiny Levels, Territories and Glory Points sections, as these only come into play after your first campaign battle.</p> <h3 id="artefacts-and-command-traits"><a href="#artefacts-and-command-traits" class="header-anchor">#</a> ARTEFACTS AND COMMAND TRAITS</h3> <p>Each fighter can be the bearer of 1 artefact of power and 1 lesser artefact. In addition, your leader can have 1 command trait. How to gain these is described on page 70.</p> <h3 id="destiny-levels"><a href="#destiny-levels" class="header-anchor">#</a> DESTINY LEVELS</h3> <p>Each fighter can gain up to 3 destiny levels. If a fighter gains a destiny level (pg 67) you can mark one of the icons to indicate so. During a campaign battle, if a fighter spends their destiny level, you can place a counter on it to indicate it is spent.</p> <h3 id="territories"><a href="#territories" class="header-anchor">#</a> TERRITORIES</h3> <p>Your warband can dominate up to six pieces of territory at any one time. The campaign quest you have chosen will detail how your warband can dominate territory and what effect territory has on your warband.</p> <h3 id="glory-points"><a href="#glory-points" class="header-anchor">#</a> GLORY POINTS</h3> <p>After a campaign battle, your warband will gain a number of glory points, which can be spent during the aftermath sequence (pg 66).</p> <h2 id="playing-a-campaign-battle"><a href="#playing-a-campaign-battle" class="header-anchor">#</a> PLAYING A CAMPAIGN BATTLE</h2> <p>Once you have chosen your campaign quest and filled out your warband roster, you are ready to start playing campaign battles against opponents. You can challenge any player to a campaign battle if they too have chosen a campaign quest and filled out a warband roster. Both players must agree to playing a campaign battle instead of a normal battle.</p> <p>To play a campaign battle, players use the core rules for setting up a battle (pg 36-37) with the following amendments:</p> <ul><li>When mustering a warband for the battle, all fighters chosen must be taken from your warband roster.</li> <li>Players may be able to muster more than 1000 points of fighters if they have dominated territory or have spent glory points on reinforcements (pg 66).</li> <li>After playing the battle, both players must complete the aftermath sequence (pg 66-70).</li></ul> <h2 id="convergences"><a href="#convergences" class="header-anchor">#</a> CONVERGENCES</h2> <p>Each campaign quest includes three unique campaign battles referred to as convergences. On the campaign progress tracker of your warband roster there are three map points marked as the first convergence, the second convergence and  the final convergence. Each of these map points is referred to as a convergence map point, and corresponds to a convergence on your campaign quest.  When a player’s warband is on a convergence map point, that warband must play the corresponding convergence and be victorious to advance further along the campaign progress tracker. The next time the player controlling that warband plays a campaign battle, they can ask their opponent if they would like to play through their convergence.  Each convergence has unique rules to follow when generating the battleplan. If both players’ warbands are on convergence map points, the players will have to decide which convergence they will play through. Only 1 player’s warband can play through their convergence, even if both warbands are embarked upon the same campaign quest and have reached the same convergence map point.</p> <p>In a convergence battle, the warband whose convergence the players are playing through is referred to as the Aspirant warband. Their opponent’s is referred to as the Adversary warband. To play through the convergence, use the guidelines for campaign battles to the left but generate the battleplan according to the corresponding convergence on the campaign quest. This means you might know some of the battleplan cards in play before you muster your warband – use this knowledge to your advantage!</p> <h3 id="decisive-battles"><a href="#decisive-battles" class="header-anchor">#</a> DECISIVE BATTLES</h3> <p>If the Aspirant warband loses the convergence, they must play through it again and win the battle before they can advance to the next map point on their campaign progress tracker. The next time the convergence is played through, it can be against the same opponent or a new opponent.</p> <h3 id="spoils-of-war"><a href="#spoils-of-war" class="header-anchor">#</a> SPOILS OF WAR</h3> <p>The player controlling the Adversary warband gets to make an additional search for lesser artefacts in the aftermath sequence after a convergence (pg 67).</p> <h3 id="the-narrative-of-convergences"><a href="#the-narrative-of-convergences" class="header-anchor">#</a> THE NARRATIVE OF CONVERGENCES</h3> <p>For the Aspirant warband, a convergence represents a pivotal moment in their quest. Success or failure balances on the edge of a blade, with only the Adversary warband standing between them and their goal. To build up the drama and tension of the battle to come, it is recommended that the player controlling the Aspirant warband reads aloud the introductory narrative to the convergence, and also tells the tale of the campaign quest their warband is embarked upon and the key events that have happened so far.</p> <p>For the player controlling the Adversary warband, playing through the convergence offers not only a chance to earn some extra treasure, but also lets you interact with the world of the Eightpoints as the fighters of your warband take on a new role, such as becoming the hired swords to a Chaos warlord or ambushers springing a trap. For some players, they might decide that they do not wish to take the role of the Adversary warband because it does not suit the character of their warband; in such cases, it is fine to ask your opponent to find another player to play through the convergence with, and to play a standard campaign battle instead.</p> <h2 id="aftermath-sequence"><a href="#aftermath-sequence" class="header-anchor">#</a> AFTERMATH SEQUENCE</h2> <p>After each campaign battle has ended, both players must complete a series of steps referred to as the aftermath sequence. It is best for both players to do this immediately after the battle has finished, as it is required that each player witnesses the aftermath sequence of the other.</p> <p>There are 7 steps in the aftermath sequence. The steps must be completed in order and are as follows:</p> <ol><li>Earn and Spend Glory Points</li> <li>Make Injury Rolls</li> <li>Roll for Destiny Levels</li> <li>Add and Remove Fighters</li> <li>Search for Lesser Artefacts</li> <li>Advance on the Campaign Progress Tracker</li> <li>Earn Artefacts of Power or Command Traits</li></ol> <h3 id="_1-earn-and-spend-glory-points"><a href="#_1-earn-and-spend-glory-points" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1. EARN AND SPEND GLORY POINTS</h3> <p>After playing a campaign battle, each player receives a number of glory points as described in the table below (these factors are all cumulative):</p> <p>Took part in a campaign battle
3
The leader of your opponent’s warband was taken down
1
At least one third of the fighters in your opponent’s warband were taken down
1
At least two thirds of the fighters in your opponent’s warband were taken down
1
All the fighters in your o pponent’s warband were taken down
1
Won the battle
2
Your opponent’s warband has at least 2 more areas of dominated territory than your warband
1</p> <p>Players note down their total glory points on their warband roster. These glory points are kept from battle to battle during the campaign until spent.</p> <p>There are a few ways players can spend their glory points during the campaign:</p> <h4 id="dominating-territory"><a href="#dominating-territory" class="header-anchor">#</a> DOMINATING TERRITORY</h4> <p>Players can choose to spend glory points straight away to dominate an area of territory. Each campaign quest has its own territory rules which detail how to dominate territory; for example, many warbands aligned to Chaos can raise monoliths with their glory points.</p> <h4 id="reinforcements"><a href="#reinforcements" class="header-anchor">#</a> REINFORCEMENTS</h4> <p>Players can choose to spend any of their glory points before picking their warband for a campaign battle if their warband has less dominated territory than their opponent. To do so, they choose to spend either 1 glory point or 3 glory points. If they spend 1 glory point they can increase the number of points they have available to spend on fighters by 50. If they spend 3 glory points, they can increase the number of points they have available to spend on fighters by 100. A player cannot spend more than 3 glory points in this manner before a campaign battle.</p> <h4 id="additional-search-roll"><a href="#additional-search-roll" class="header-anchor">#</a> ADDITIONAL SEARCH ROLL</h4> <p>Players can choose to spend glory points in the Search for Lesser Artefacts step. To do so, they can choose to spend 3 glory points to make an additional search roll upon the lesser artefacts table (pg 68-69). A player cannot spend more than 3 glory points in this manner during that step.</p> <h3 id="_2-make-injury-rolls"><a href="#_2-make-injury-rolls" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. MAKE INJURY ROLLS</h3> <p>If a fighter from your warband was taken down in the battle, there is a chance the wounds received will be fatal and the fighter will die. You must make an injury roll for each fighter that was taken out in the battle. To do so, roll a 2D6 and consult the table below.
If you roll the ‘Slain’ result for a fighter, you must remove that fighter from your warband roster. If that fighter has lesser artefacts or artefacts of power, these too are lost.
This will free up a space on your warband roster to add a new fighter (see opposite).</p> <p>2D6 RESULT
2-3 Slain 4-5 Lost Favour
6+ Full Recovery</p> <h4 id="destined-for-greatness"><a href="#destined-for-greatness" class="header-anchor">#</a> DESTINED FOR GREATNESS</h4> <p>If you roll the ‘Slain’ result for a fighter with the Leader runemark ( ), that fighter does not die. Instead treat the result as ‘Lost Favour’.</p> <h4 id="lost-favour"><a href="#lost-favour" class="header-anchor">#</a> LOST FAVOUR</h4> <p>If you roll the ‘Lost Favour’ result for a fighter that has gained any destiny levels, they lose one of those destiny levels. Otherwise, it has no effect.</p> <h4 id="full-recovery"><a href="#full-recovery" class="header-anchor">#</a> FULL RECOVERY</h4> <p>If you roll the ‘Full Recovery’ result for a fighter, they suffer no effects.</p> <h3 id="_3-roll-for-destiny-levels"><a href="#_3-roll-for-destiny-levels" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. ROLL FOR DESTINY LEVELS</h3> <p>As your warband grows in power, certain fighters will begin to carve their own legends and stand apart as destined by the gods for glory.</p> <p>After a campaign battle, you can make a destiny roll for each fighter from your warband that was not taken down during the battle. To do so, roll a dice; on the roll of a 6 that fighter gains a destiny level. Mark it on your warband roster by colouring in a destiny level icon.</p> <p>A fighter can have up to 3 destiny levels at once. Each destiny level gives the following benefit in future campaign battles:</p> <h4 id="favour-of-the-gods"><a href="#favour-of-the-gods" class="header-anchor">#</a> FAVOUR OF THE GODS</h4> <p>During a campaign battle, a player can choose to spend 1 of their fighter’s destiny levels to re-roll 1 dice during an attack action made by that fighter. A spent destiny level replenishes at the end of the battle.</p> <h3 id="_4-add-and-remove-fighters"><a href="#_4-add-and-remove-fighters" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. ADD AND REMOVE FIGHTERS</h3> <p>Players can choose to remove any fighters from their warband roster and add new fighters if there is space.</p> <p>This step uses the following rules:</p> <ul><li>Any fighter except the leader can be removed from your warband roster. If you do so, any lesser artefacts or artefacts of power that fighter bears are lost.</li> <li>New fighters can be added to the warband roster. The limits on page 64 still apply when adding new fighters.</li></ul> <h3 id="_5-search-for-lesser-artefacts"><a href="#_5-search-for-lesser-artefacts" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. SEARCH FOR LESSER ARTEFACTS</h3> <blockquote><p>There are many items of treasure that warbands may come to acquire. Some are much sought- after treasures found in hidden vaults, locked away since the Age of Myth amidst the ruins circling the Varanspire; others are more common and can be bartered for and obtained in the dark streets of anarchic settlements.</p></blockquote> <p>After a campaign battle, each player can make 1 search roll upon the lesser artefacts table (pg 68-69) to see if they obtain any lesser artefacts. To do so, roll 2 dice: the first indicates the tens roll, the second indicates the units roll (this is also referred to as a D66).

A fighter can bear no more than 1 lesser artefact at any time, but can bear both a lesser artefact and an artefact of power (pg 70). Make a note on your warband roster of which fighter bears the lesser artefact.</p> <p>A lesser artefact can never be swapped from one fighter to another, but if you wish for a fighter who already bears a lesser artefact to bear another, you can discard any lesser artefacts they have to allow you to do so.</p> <h4 id="using-lesser-artefacts"><a href="#using-lesser-artefacts" class="header-anchor">#</a> USING LESSER ARTEFACTS</h4> <p>Each lesser artefact has a description of how they work on the lesser artefacts table. The rules for a lesser artefact will often refer to the bearer. The bearer is the fighter that bears that lesser artefact. Some lesser artefacts are labelled as [Consumable]. These give the bearer a one-use action they can make when activated. Once the action has been made, that lesser artefact is then removed from your warband roster.</p> <p>Other lesser artefacts are labelled as [Perishable]. These lesser artefacts have rules which are always in play. This means they do not require an action to trigger their effect. However, at the end of a campaign battle, you must roll a dice for each [Perishable] lesser artefact borne by a fighter from your warband that took part in that battle. On a 4+, the lesser artefact retains its power and can remain on your warband roster. On a 1-3, the lesser artefact has lost its power: remove it from your warband roster.</p> <h3 id="_6-advance-on-the-campaign-progress-tracker"><a href="#_6-advance-on-the-campaign-progress-tracker" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. ADVANCE ON THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESS TRACKER</h3> <p>After each campaign battle, both players can advance their warband on their campaign progress tracker 1 map point closer to the map point labelled ‘Campaign Goal’.
The exception to this is if a player’s warband is currently on a convergence map point. In this case, the player’s warband can only advance if they played the corresponding convergence as the Aspirant warband (pg 65) and won the battle.</p> <h3 id="_7-earn-artefacts-of-power-and-command-traits"><a href="#_7-earn-artefacts-of-power-and-command-traits" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7. EARN ARTEFACTS OF POWER AND COMMAND TRAITS</h3> <p>After advancing your warband on the campaign progress tracker, if it has moved onto a map point marked ‘Artefact of Power’ or ‘Command Trait’, you will receive one of these as described below:</p> <h4 id="artefacts-of-power"><a href="#artefacts-of-power" class="header-anchor">#</a> ARTEFACTS OF POWER</h4> <p>When you receive an artefact of power, pick one from the artefact of power table on your campaign quest. Alternatively, you can roll a D3 to determine which artefact of power you receive. Artefacts of power follow many of the same rules as lesser artefacts (pg 67). First,
you must decide which fighter in your warband will bear it. A fighter can bear no more than 1 artefact of power at any time, but can bear both an artefact of power and a lesser artefact. Make a note on your warband roster of which fighter bears the artefact of power.
If the fighter you wish to bear the artefact of power already bears another, you can first give the old artefact of power to a fighter who bears none, and then give the first fighter the new artefact of power. This is the only time an artefact of power can be swapped from one fighter to another.
Each artefact of power has a description of how it works on the artefact of power table on each campaign quest. The rules for artefacts of power will often refer to the bearer. The bearer is
the fighter that bears that artefact of power. Unlike lesser artefacts, artefacts of power are not labelled as [Consumable] or [Perishable]. An artefact of power instead provides a permanent benefit to the fighter that bears it.</p> <h4 id="command-traits"><a href="#command-traits" class="header-anchor">#</a> COMMAND TRAITS</h4> <p>When you receive a command trait, pick one from the command trait table on your campaign quest. Alternatively, you can roll a D3 to determine which command trait you receive. A command trait is an additional bonus given to your leader.
Each command trait has a description of how it works on the command trait table on each campaign quest. Each provides a permanent benefit to the fighter.
A leader can only have 1 command trait. If you receive another (for example, if you move on to a new campaign quest after completing your first – see opposite), you can choose 1 of the other fighters in your warband to become a favoured warrior (see below).</p> <h4 id="favoured-warriors"><a href="#favoured-warriors" class="header-anchor">#</a> FAVOURED WARRIORS</h4> <p>As your warband grows in power, some fighters will stand apart from their peers, having earned the favour of their leader through glorious feats in battle.</p> <p>If your warband receives a command trait but your leader already has one, you can at that point nominate one of the other fighters in your warband to become the favoured warrior. This fighter receives the command trait instead of your leader, in the same manner a leader would (see above). A warband can only have 1 favoured warrior, so any further command traits gained are discarded. However, if the favoured warrior has been slain or removed from the warband when a new command trait is gained, you can nominate a new fighter to be the favoured warrior and give them that command trait.
When you nominate a fighter to become the favoured warrior, it can be fun to roll on the leader/
favoured warrior background table in the background tables section (pg 134-151) to see how their character has developed.</p> <h2 id="completing-a-campaign-quest"><a href="#completing-a-campaign-quest" class="header-anchor">#</a> COMPLETING A CAMPAIGN QUEST</h2> <p>When your warband advances onto the map point marked as the campaign goal, your warband is said to have completed its quest. On the campaign quest you will find a page reference that will lead you to both the narrative outcome of your quest and your reward (a mighty artefact of power).</p> <p>A warband that has completed its campaign quest can continue to play campaign battles but will no longer advance a map point during the aftermath sequence.</p> <h3 id="choosing-a-new-campaign-quest"><a href="#choosing-a-new-campaign-quest" class="header-anchor">#</a> CHOOSING A NEW CAMPAIGN QUEST</h3> <p>Once they have completed their campaign quest, some warbands choose to remain and exert dominance over the territories they have conquered. For others, the call of their gods, the allure of fresh challenges and the promise of further artefacts of power leads them to leave behind their territories as they embark on a new quest.</p> <p>If you have completed your campaign quest, you can choose to start a new campaign quest with the same warband roster. To do so, follow these steps:</p> <ol><li>Choose a new campaign quest with a faction runemark that matches the one on your warband roster. Note down the new campaign quest on your warband roster.</li> <li>Remove all dominated territories and glory points from your warband roster.</li> <li>Move your warband back to the map point labelled ‘Start’ on the campaign progress tracker.</li></ol> <p>Once a campaign quest has been completed, the same campaign quest cannot be started again by the same warband.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
