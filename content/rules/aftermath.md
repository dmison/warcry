## AFTERMATH SEQUENCE

After each campaign battle has ended, both players must complete a series of steps referred to as the aftermath sequence. It is best for both players to do this immediately after the battle has finished, as it is required that each player witnesses the aftermath sequence of the other.

There are 7 steps in the aftermath sequence. The steps must be completed in order and are as follows:

1.	Earn and Spend Glory Points
2.	Make Injury Rolls
3.	Roll for Destiny Levels
4.	Add and Remove Fighters
5.	Search for Lesser Artefacts
6.	Advance on the Campaign Progress Tracker
7. Earn Artefacts of Power or Command Traits



### 1. EARN AND SPEND GLORY POINTS

After playing a campaign battle, each player receives a number of glory points as described in the table below (these factors are all cumulative):

Took part in a campaign battle
3
The leader of your opponent’s warband was taken down
1
At least one third of the fighters in your opponent’s warband were taken down
1
At least two thirds of the fighters in your opponent’s warband were taken down
1
All the fighters in your o pponent’s warband were taken down
1
Won the battle
2
Your opponent’s warband has at least 2 more areas of dominated territory than your warband
1



Players note down their total glory points on their warband roster. These glory points are kept from battle to battle during the campaign until spent.

There are a few ways players can spend their glory points during the campaign:

#### DOMINATING TERRITORY
Players can choose to spend glory points straight away to dominate an area of territory. Each campaign quest has its own territory rules which detail how to dominate territory; for example, many warbands aligned to Chaos can raise monoliths with their glory points.

#### REINFORCEMENTS
Players can choose to spend any of their glory points before picking their warband for a campaign battle if their warband has less dominated territory than their opponent. To do so, they choose to spend either 1 glory point or 3 glory points. If they spend 1 glory point they can increase the number of points they have available to spend on fighters by 50. If they spend 3 glory points, they can increase the number of points they have available to spend on fighters by 100. A player cannot spend more than 3 glory points in this manner before a campaign battle.

#### ADDITIONAL SEARCH ROLL
Players can choose to spend glory points in the Search for Lesser Artefacts step. To do so, they can choose to spend 3 glory points to make an additional search roll upon the lesser artefacts table (pg 68-69). A player cannot spend more than 3 glory points in this manner during that step.



### 2. MAKE INJURY ROLLS

If a fighter from your warband was taken down in the battle, there is a chance the wounds received will be fatal and the fighter will die. You must make an injury roll for each fighter that was taken out in the battle. To do so, roll a 2D6 and consult the table below.
If you roll the ‘Slain’ result for a fighter, you must remove that fighter from your warband roster. If that fighter has lesser artefacts or artefacts of power, these too are lost.
This will free up a space on your warband roster to add a new fighter (see opposite).

2D6 RESULT
2-3 Slain 4-5 Lost Favour
6+ Full Recovery

#### DESTINED FOR GREATNESS
If you roll the ‘Slain’ result for a fighter with the Leader runemark ( ), that fighter does not die. Instead treat the result as ‘Lost Favour’.

#### LOST FAVOUR
If you roll the ‘Lost Favour’ result for a fighter that has gained any destiny levels, they lose one of those destiny levels. Otherwise, it has no effect.

#### FULL RECOVERY
If you roll the ‘Full Recovery’ result for a fighter, they suffer no effects.


### 3. ROLL FOR DESTINY LEVELS
As your warband grows in power, certain fighters will begin to carve their own legends and stand apart as destined by the gods for glory.

After a campaign battle, you can make a destiny roll for each fighter from your warband that was not taken down during the battle. To do so, roll a dice; on the roll of a 6 that fighter gains a destiny level. Mark it on your warband roster by colouring in a destiny level icon.

A fighter can have up to 3 destiny levels at once. Each destiny level gives the following benefit in future campaign battles:

#### FAVOUR OF THE GODS
During a campaign battle, a player can choose to spend 1 of their fighter’s destiny levels to re-roll 1 dice during an attack action made by that fighter. A spent destiny level replenishes at the end of the battle.


### 4. ADD AND REMOVE FIGHTERS

Players can choose to remove any fighters from their warband roster and add new fighters if there is space.

This step uses the following rules:

- Any fighter except the leader can be removed from your warband roster. If you do so, any lesser artefacts or artefacts of power that fighter bears are lost.
- New fighters can be added to the warband roster. The limits on page 64 still apply when adding new fighters.

### 5. SEARCH FOR LESSER ARTEFACTS

> There are many items of treasure that warbands may come to acquire. Some are much sought- after treasures found in hidden vaults, locked away since the Age of Myth amidst the ruins circling the Varanspire; others are more common and can be bartered for and obtained in the dark streets of anarchic settlements.

After a campaign battle, each player can make 1 search roll upon the lesser artefacts table (pg 68-69) to see if they obtain any lesser artefacts. To do so, roll 2 dice: the first indicates the tens roll, the second indicates the units roll (this is also referred to as a D66). Then, look up the corresponding result on the table.

Search for Lesser artefacts table

| D66 | Found |
| :-: | :- |
| 11-20 | Nothing but dust |
| 21-22 | HEALING POTION |
| 23-24 | SWIFTWIND DUST |
| 25-26 | SILKSTRIDER WEBBING |
| 31-32 | SKIN OF FLAME-ALE |
| 33-34 | JAR OF CHAMONIC GLOWFLIES |
| 35-36 | CARVOLAX-SCALE ANKLET |
| 41-42 | CHRONOMANTIC DIAL |
| 43-44 | IRONOAK SEED |
| 45-46 | GREATER HEALING POTION |
| 51-52 | GODBEAST IDOL |
| 53-54 | VIAL OF JABBERSLYTHE BLOOD |
| 55-56 | UR-GOLD SIGIL |
| 61 | BLIGHT SERPENT VENOM |
| 62 | BAUBLE OF SHADOWS |
| 63 | FLASK OF AQUA GHYRANIS |
| 64 | PENDANT OF BLOODGLASS |
| 65 | RAVEN-FEATHER NECKLACE |
| 66 | RUNE-ETCHED VAMBRACES |

#### BEARING LESSER ARTEFACTS

If your warband obtains a lesser artefact, you must decide which one of the fighters in your warband will bear it. A fighter can bear no more than 1 lesser artefact at any time, but can bear both a lesser artefact and an artefact of power (pg 70). Make a note on your warband roster of which fighter bears the lesser artefact.

A lesser artefact can never be swapped from one fighter to another, but if you wish for a fighter who already bears a lesser artefact to bear another, you can discard any lesser artefacts they have to allow you to do so.

#### USING LESSER ARTEFACTS

Each lesser artefact has a description of how they work on the lesser artefacts table. The rules for a lesser artefact will often refer to the bearer. The bearer is the fighter that bears that lesser artefact. Some lesser artefacts are labelled as [Consumable]. These give the bearer a one-use action they can make when activated. Once the action has been made, that lesser artefact is then removed from your warband roster.

Other lesser artefacts are labelled as [Perishable]. These lesser artefacts have rules which are always in play. This means they do not require an action to trigger their effect. However, at the end of a campaign battle, you must roll a dice for each [Perishable] lesser artefact borne by a fighter from your warband that took part in that battle. On a 4+, the lesser artefact retains its power and can remain on your warband roster. On a 1-3, the lesser artefact has lost its power: remove it from your warband roster.

### 6. ADVANCE ON THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESS TRACKER

After each campaign battle, both players can advance their warband on their campaign progress tracker 1 map point closer to the map point labelled ‘Campaign Goal’.
The exception to this is if a player’s warband is currently on a convergence map point. In this case, the player’s warband can only advance if they played the corresponding convergence as the Aspirant warband (pg 65) and won the battle.


### 7. EARN ARTEFACTS OF POWER AND COMMAND TRAITS

After advancing your warband on the campaign progress tracker, if it has moved onto a map point marked ‘Artefact of Power’ or ‘Command Trait’, you will receive one of these as described below:

#### ARTEFACTS OF POWER
When you receive an artefact of power, pick one from the artefact of power table on your campaign quest. Alternatively, you can roll a D3 to determine which artefact of power you receive. Artefacts of power follow many of the same rules as lesser artefacts (pg 67). First,
you must decide which fighter in your warband will bear it. A fighter can bear no more than 1 artefact of power at any time, but can bear both an artefact of power and a lesser artefact. Make a note on your warband roster of which fighter bears the artefact of power.
If the fighter you wish to bear the artefact of power already bears another, you can first give the old artefact of power to a fighter who bears none, and then give the first fighter the new artefact of power. This is the only time an artefact of power can be swapped from one fighter to another.
Each artefact of power has a description of how it works on the artefact of power table on each campaign quest. The rules for artefacts of power will often refer to the bearer. The bearer is
the fighter that bears that artefact of power. Unlike lesser artefacts, artefacts of power are not labelled as [Consumable] or [Perishable]. An artefact of power instead provides a permanent benefit to the fighter that bears it.

#### COMMAND TRAITS

When you receive a command trait, pick one from the command trait table on your campaign quest. Alternatively, you can roll a D3 to determine which command trait you receive. A command trait is an additional bonus given to your leader.
Each command trait has a description of how it works on the command trait table on each campaign quest. Each provides a permanent benefit to the fighter.
A leader can only have 1 command trait. If you receive another (for example, if you move on to a new campaign quest after completing your first – see opposite), you can choose 1 of the other fighters in your warband to become a favoured warrior (see below).

#### FAVOURED WARRIORS
As your warband grows in power, some fighters will stand apart from their peers, having earned the favour of their leader through glorious feats in battle.

If your warband receives a command trait but your leader already has one, you can at that point nominate one of the other fighters in your warband to become the favoured warrior. This fighter receives the command trait instead of your leader, in the same manner a leader would (see above). A warband can only have 1 favoured warrior, so any further command traits gained are discarded. However, if the favoured warrior has been slain or removed from the warband when a new command trait is gained, you can nominate a new fighter to be the favoured warrior and give them that command trait.
When you nominate a fighter to become the favoured warrior, it can be fun to roll on the leader/
favoured warrior background table in the background tables section (pg 134-151) to see how their character has developed.


## COMPLETING A CAMPAIGN QUEST

When your warband advances onto the map point marked as the campaign goal, your warband is said to have completed its quest. On the campaign quest you will find a page reference that will lead you to both the narrative outcome of your quest and your reward (a mighty artefact of power).

A warband that has completed its campaign quest can continue to play campaign battles but will no longer advance a map point during the aftermath sequence.

### CHOOSING A NEW CAMPAIGN QUEST

Once they have completed their campaign quest, some warbands choose to remain and exert dominance over the territories they have conquered. For others, the call of their gods, the allure of fresh challenges and the promise of further artefacts of power leads them to leave behind their territories as they embark on a new quest.

If you have completed your campaign quest, you can choose to start a new campaign quest with the same warband roster. To do so, follow these steps:

1.	Choose a new campaign quest with a faction runemark that matches the one on your warband roster. Note down the new campaign quest on your warband roster.
2.	Remove all dominated territories and glory points from your warband roster.
3.	Move your warband back to the map point labelled ‘Start’ on the campaign progress tracker.

Once a campaign quest has been completed, the same campaign quest cannot be started again by the same warband.
