# MONSTERS

> The Eigbtpoints is home to more than just corrupted tribesmen. Monsters and beasts of all kinds dwell in this tainted land; the strongest warbands seek to bind such creatures to their will, though that is easier said than done...

A monster is a fighter with the <Runemark mark="GARGANTUAN" /> runemark.

Monsters are subject to the following rules:

## DEPLOYING MONSTERS

When monsters are deployed, they must be placed wholly within 5 inches horizontally of a deployment point instead of wholly within 3 inches.

## ACTIVATING MONSTERS 

A monster can be activated 3 time in a battle round instead of only once, but each time it is activated, it can make only 1 action instead of 2.

Each time a monster is activated, it can use 1 ability before or after its action.

If a monster makes a wait action, its activation immediately ends; the monster is not said to be waiting and the rules for waiting do not apply.

## MONSTERS AND TREASURE

Monsters can never carry treasure.

## MONSTERS AND UNIVERSAL ABILITIES

Monsters cannot use universal abilities. Instead, if any monsters are in play, they can use the Monster Abilities.

| DICE | Monster Ability | Description |
| :- | :- | :- | 
| DOUBLE | Monstrous Reach | Until the end of this fighter's activation, do not count the vertical distance when measuring the range for attack actions made by this fighter |
| TRIPLE | Drag and Maul | Pick a visible enemy fighter within 6" of this fighter. Remove that fighter from the battlefield and set them up within 1" of this  fighter. Then roll a number of dice equal to the value of this ability. For each 4+, allocate 3 damage point to that fighter. |
| QUAD | Demolishing Rampage | Pick a terrain feature within 1 inch of this fighter. In an order of your choice, place each objective, treasure token and fighter that is on that terrain feature (and on any other terrain feature that is on that terrain feature) on the battlefield floor in a location at your choice as close as possible horizontally to its current location. Then, in the order of your choice, any fighters placed on the battletield in this manner suffers impact damage. Then, remove the terrain fea1ure(s). |
