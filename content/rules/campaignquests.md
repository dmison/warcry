# CAMPAIGN QUESTS

At the heart of every Warcry campaign is the quest your warband is striving to achieve. This is referred to as a campaign quest. You can find a whole array of different campaign quests to choose from in the campaign section of this book (pg 82-127). Additional campaign quests can also be found at warcry.com and in White Dwarf.

Each campaign quest has one or more faction runemarks to denote which warbands can embark upon it. The campaign quests in the campaign section have a single faction runemark, and so choosing a campaign quest often goes hand- in-hand with choosing which warband you wish to play through the campaign with. In addition, each campaign quest contains the following:

## TERRITORY RULES
Each campaign quest has its own territory rules that enable your warband to dominate areas within the Eightpoints. For the aspiring followers of the Dark Gods, these territory rules allow your warband to raise sinister monoliths and enslave chaotic beasts as thralls. For other warbands, such as the Stormcast Eternals, the territory rules will allow your warband to purge the chaotic taint from the lands and create areas of hallowed ground. The territory rules for each campaign quest are detailed in full upon it.

## ARTEFACTS OF POWER & COMMAND TRAITS TABLES

Each campaign quest has 1 table of artefacts of power and 1 table of command traits. As your warband progresses you will be awarded items from these lists at certain points; this is explained in the aftermath sequence (pg 66-70).
