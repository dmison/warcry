# TERRAIN

> During any battle there will be 1 or more terrain features on the battlefield, as dictated by the terrain card in play. Fighters can interact with terrain features in numerous ways when making move actions (pg 41). This section introduces the other interactions fighters can have with terrain features, and also describes the unique types of terrain features. 

> Terrain features come in many shapes and sizes. When a rule refers to a terrain feature, it refers to the scenery model itself and any base it is mounted upon, but not any empty space around or within it. 

## OBSTACLES 

> Some terrain features, or some parts of terrain features, can be defined as an obstacle. An obstacle is any part of a terrain feature that prevents a fighter from moving horizontally and that extends vertically more than 1"  high from the battlefield floor or the platform upon which it is placed. 


## PLATFORMS 

> Some terrain features, or some parts of a terrain feature, can be defined as a platform. A platform is a horizontally flat surface on a terrain feature with a surface area larger than 1" by 1", that is raised 1" or higher above the battlefield floor. 

## DEADLY TERRAIN 

> Some terrain features, or parts of terrain features, are said to be deadly terrain. If you are using the terrain that comes with Warcry, you can see which parts of those terrain features are deadly terrain on page 46. 

> If you are using other terrain features, you should agree with your opponent which parts of those terrain features are deadly terrain when the battlefield is first set up. Parts of terrain features that are deadly terrain can still be platforms or obstacles if they fall under the definitions of either. 

> If a fighter ever moves onto deadly terrain, for example, if they begin to climb deadly terrain or finish a jump upon deadly terrain, they immediately suffer impact damage (pg 42). In addition, if a fallen fighter (pg 42) is placed within 1" of deadly terrain, they immediately suffer impact damage. 

> Note, it is possible for a fighter to suffer impact damage more than once due to deadly terrain. For example, if a fallen fighter is placed within 1" of deadly terrain and is now 3" or more vertically lower than their location before they fell, that fighter would suffer impact damage twice (and would therefore make 2 dice rolls). 

## STAIRS AND LADDERS 

> Some terrain features, or parts of terrain features, are said to be stairs or ladders. You can see an example of stairs on page 46. Stairs and ladders are treated as obstacles, with the following exceptions: 

> - Fighters that finish their activation climbing stairs or a ladder are not said to have fallen and can remain part way up stairs or a ladder (if it is not possible to physically place the fighter in their current location, make a note of where they are).  

critical hits against a fighter climbing stairs or a ladder can cause them to fall 

## ARCHWAYS AND DOORS 

> Some terrain features, or parts of terrain features, are said to be archways or doors. If you are using the terrain that comes with Warcry, you can see which parts of those terrain features are archways or doors on page 46. 

> If you are using other terrain features, you should agree with your opponent which parts of those terrain features are either archways or doors when the battlefield is first set up. Archways and doors can still be platforms or obstacles if they fall under the definitions of either (usually they will be obstacles, but something like a trapdoor could be part of a platform). 

> As part of a move action, if a fighter is touching a part of a terrain feature defined as an archway or a door, that fighter can make a normal move through it even if the miniature or its base is too large to physically fit through (or it is blocked completely, as in the case of a closed door). This is an exception to the rule which states that a fighter cannot move through any part of a terrain feature. 

> To move through an archway or a door, first measure the distance in a straight line through the horizontal centre of the archway or doorway. If the fighter has sufficient movement to pass through the archway or door and be placed on the other side, they can move through it. 

> When fighters move through archways and doors, all other movement rules must still be followed (for example, they cannot move through another fighter). 

### RESTRICTIONS 

> Fighters with any of the following runemarks cannot move through archways: 

> - <Runemark mark="Gargantuan" />
> - <Runemark mark="Mount" /> 

> Fighters with any of the following runemarks cannot move through doors: 

> - <Runemark mark="Gargantuan" />
> - <Runemark mark="Mount" />
