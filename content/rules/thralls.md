# THRALLS

> Savage creatures twisted by the touch of Chaos can be found all across the Eightpoints can dominate these weak-minded beasts with the enrapturing call of raised monoliths, or else bring them into servitude through dark pacts and gruesome offerings.

In certain battles, a player may be able to include special fighters in their warband known as thralls. This is usually in a campaign battle (pg 63) when a warband’s territory rules allow them to do so, but there are also other ways of including thralls in a warband (for example, the Sinister Bargain twist card allows a player to include 1 thrall in their warband).

If a player is allowed to include any thralls in their warband, they can choose any fighter with the Chaotic Beast faction runemark ( ) that has the thrall runemark ( ) to become their thrall, and include that fighter in their warband for that battle. Thralls are ignored for the purposes of the rule that requires fighters in a warband to all share the same faction runemark.

When a chaotic beast is chosen to become a thrall, it is no longer subject to the Territorial Predators or the Bestial Intellects rules, and is instead treated as a friendly fighter in that player’s warband.

When a player activates a thrall in their warband, they can use any of their ability dice to use abilities with that thrall. A thrall can use the universal abilities (pg 40) and the abilities on their ability card.
