# ABILITIES

A fighter can also use 1 ability during its activation if the player activating that fighter has sufficient ability dice. The ability can be used either before the first action or after the first or second actions made by that fighter.

Each warband has set of unique abilities on its ability card. There are also 5 universal abilities that fighters from any warband can use (see opposite). Each ability will stipulate if it requires a [double], a [triple] or a [quad].

Once a fighter has used an ability, discard the ability dice used for that ability. You can use a [triple] for an ability that requires a [double], or a [quad] for an ability that requires a [triple] or [double], but if you do so all those ability dice are discarded.

The rule for an ability may sometimes refer to the value of that ability. This refers to the score shown on the ability dice used for that ability. For example, if a player has a [double] consisting of 2 ability dice with the score of ‘5’ shown on each ability dice, the value of that ability is 5.

## BONUS ACTIONS

If an ability lets a fighter make any bonus actions, these are actions in addition to the 2 actions they can carry out during an activation.

## RUNEMARKS

Some abilities can only be used by fighters with certain runemarks. Any runemarks required will be shown to the left of the ability on the ability card. For example, the Inspiring Presence ability (see below) can only be used by fighters with the <Runemark mark="Leader" /> runemark. The runemarks a fighter has can be found on their fighter card (pg 34).

## DESPERATE LAST STAND

When all but 1 fighter in a player’s warband have been taken down(pg 44), the remaining fighter can use any number of abilities if the player activating that fighter has sufficient ability dice. This means that the fighter can use multiple abilities at each point when it would normally only be able to use 1 (for example, it can use multiple abilities before its first action, and multiple abilities again after its first or second action).
