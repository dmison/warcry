# CHAOTIC BEASTS

> The corrupting power of Chaos has fully defiled the Eightpoints over the course of centuries, transforming flora and fauna alike into unnatural, mutated abominations. Many of the beasts that make their lairs in the lands around the Varanspire are little more than frenzied monsters, but others possess an unsettling cunning, and will even follow a warband into battle in return for fresh meat or some other, darker incentive.

A fighter with the <Runemark mark="Chaotic Beast" /> faction runemark on their fighter card is referred to as a chaotic beast. A chaotic beast is a type of fighter that belongs to no player’s warband. Chaotic beasts will come into play during a battle when twist cards with the <Runemark mark="WILD CREATURES" /> runemark are drawn. Like all other fighters, chaotic beasts each have a fighter card that details their characteristics and weapons, and an ability card.

Each twist card will explain if and how any chaotic beasts are set up on the battlefield. During a battle, if there are any chaotic beasts on the battlefield, use the following rules:

## TERRITORIAL PREDATORS 

Chaotic beasts treat all fighters as enemy fighters, except for fighters that have the same combination of runemarks as themselves, which they treat as friendly fighters. This means that a chaotic beast will treat another chaotic beast as an enemy fighter if it does not have identical runemarks (e.g. if it has a different fighter card). However, chaotic beasts will always treat thralls (see opposite) as enemy fighters even if they share identical runemarks.

## BESTIAL INTELLECTS 

When it is a player’s turn to choose a fighter from their warband to activate, they can instead choose a chaotic beast that has not yet activated. When they do so, the player first rolls a dice. On a 3-6 they can activate that chaotic beast as normal. On a 1-2, their opponent can instead activate that chaotic beast. When this happens, it still counts as the turn of the player who chose the chaotic beast, despite their opponent being the one who gets to activate it. If you are playing a battle with more than 2 players and a roll of a 1-2 occurs when activating a chaotic beast, the opponents of the activating player roll off and the winner can activate that chaotic beast.

If there are any chaotic beasts in play that have not yet been activated that combat phase, a player must pick 1 of those chaotic beasts to activate and cannot pass.

A chaotic beast can never use the wait action as its first action in its activation.

## CHAOTIC BEASTS AND ABILITIES 

When a player activates a chaotic beast, they can use any of their ability dice to use abilities with that chaotic beast. A chaotic beast can use abilities in the same manner as any other fighter. As well as the universal abilities (pg 40), chaotic beasts have their own abilities.
