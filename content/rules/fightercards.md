# Fighter Cards

> On every fighter card there will be 1 or more weapons that the fighter can use when making an attack action. Each weapon has 4 characteristics: the Range characteristic, the Attacks characteristic, the  Strength characteristic and the Damage characteristic.


### RANGE 

> The range of a weapon is a number of inches equal to its Range characteristic. For example if a weapon has a Range characteristic of 3, an enemy fighter within 3" of the fighter making the attack action can be targeted by attack actions using that weapon (see Measuring Distances, pg 35). Some weapons have a minimum range, which means that they cannot be used to target fighters that are within a certain range. For example, a weapon that has a Range characteristic of 6-20 can target a fighter within 20", but not if that fighter is within 6".
