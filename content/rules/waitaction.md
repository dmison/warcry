# WAIT ACTION

> A wait action can be used in two ways. If a fighter makes the wait action as their last action in their activation, their activation ends. The wait action is used in this manner simply when the fighter has nothing else to do (for example, if they are not in range to attack and do not wish to move).

> Alternatively, if a fighter uses the wait action as their first action in their activation, the fighter is said to be waiting. Place a wait token by the fighter to indicate it is waiting. If a fighter makes a wait action in this manner the activation ends, but that fighter can be activated once more later in that combat phase. When that fighter is activated for the second time, they can only make 1 action in that activation.

## Wait Actions and Abilities

> If a fighter activates for a second time in the combat phase as a result of a wait action, they can use 1 ability in their second activation even if an ability was used the first time they activated. In addition, when activating for the second time, that 1 ability can be used by the fighter either before their action or after their action.

> When a rule or ability refers to ‘this fighter’s activation’, it means the fighter’s current activation.
