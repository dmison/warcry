# SETTING UP A BATTLE 

> Blades glint in the sun and war cries split the air as two rival bands of killers face off. Only one can emerge victorious – for the defeated there is only ignominy and death. 

This section explains how to set up a battle between two warbands. There are rules later on in this book that detail battles with more than two players (pg 52-61), and rules that detail a special kind of battle known as a convergence (pg 65). For most games of Warcry, however, you will use the rules in this section.

## THE BATTLEFIELD 

Warcry battles are fought upon a battlefield. This can be any flat surface upon which the fighters can stand. Warcry battlefield mats are 22" in width and 30" in length, and the battleplan cards are designed to work especially well with these battlefield mats, but any flat surface roughly 22" by 30" will be suitable. 

If a rule refers to the battlefield floor, this includes only the flat surface the battle is played upon and not any of the terrain features. For example, if a rule requires 
an objective to be placed on the battlefield floor, it cannot be placed on a terrain feature. If a rule refers to the battlefield, this includes both the battlefield floor and terrain features.

## THE WARBANDS 

Each player in a Warcry battle controls a warband of fighters. When first setting up the battle, the players each muster a warband by adhering to the following rules: 

1. The warband must include at least 3 and no more than 15 fighters. 
2. The combined points value of all the fighters in a player’s warband cannot exceed 1000. 
3. All fighters in a player’s warband must share the same faction runemark. 
4. The warband must include 1 fighter with the <Runemark mark="Leader" /> runemark and cannot include more than 1 fighter with the <Runemark mark="Leader" /> runemark. 

Once both players have mustered their warbands, they reveal their warbands to each other.

## THE PRIORITY ROLL 

The players now roll off. This is an important roll-off as it will determine who takes priority when setting up the battle. This roll-off is referred to as the priority roll.

## BATTLE GROUPS 
Starting with the player who lost the priority roll, each player splits their warband into three groups: the Dagger, the Shield and the Hammer. Each of these groups is referred to as a battle group. Each battle group must have at least 1 fighter and cannot have more than half the total fighters in the warband. In addition, at least a third of the fighters in the warband (rounding up) must be in the Shield.

## THE BATTLEPLAN 
Warcry battles use randomly drawn battleplan cards to decide how the terrain and warbands are set up, what the victory condition of the battle is, and if there are any twists in play. Once both warbands have been separated into their battle groups, the players organise the battleplan cards into the following four decks and give each deck a shuffle: 

1. TERRAIN DECK
2. DEPLOYMENT DECK
3. VICTORY DECK
4. TWIST DECK 

If neither player has access to the battleplan cards, you can find battleplan generator tables on pages 152-159. 

The player that won the priority roll deals out a card from each deck, placing it face up so that all players can see the card. The upwards arrow on the terrain cards corresponds to the upwards arrow on the deployment cards, so players know which way they are orientated. 

Once all battleplan cards have been drawn, the rest can be packed away as they will have no further effect upon the battle. The players next resolve the cards in the following order: 

### 1. TERRAIN CARD

Every terrain card has a unique layout of terrain features. Set up the terrain features shown on the terrain card in the locations shown for them. 
The terrain cards in Warcry allow players to set up a range of battlefields using the terrain features in the core set. However, Warcry is the perfect game for players to really embrace the narrative and create thematic battlefields with unique terrain features. If all players agree, you can substitute one or more of the terrain features with different terrain features from your collection. 

### 2. DEPLOYMENT CARD

On every deployment card there are two sets of these three symbols: (Dagger), (Shield) and (Hammer). One set is in red; the other is in blue. These are referred to as deployment points, and each corresponds to one of the battle groups in a player’s warband. 

The player that won the priority roll chooses which player uses the red deployment points and which player uses the blue deployment points for the battle. The locations of each player’s deployment points are shown on the deployment card. 

The player that won the priority roll then sets up their Dagger, followed by their opponent. Then the players set up their Shields in the same order, and finally their Hammers in the same order. Each time a battle group is set up, all fighters from that battle group must be set up wholly within 3" horizontally, but any distance vertically, of the corresponding deployment point on the battlefield floor or a platform (pg 46). 

#### Reserve Battle Groups 

If a deployment point for a battle group is labelled ‘RND2’ or ‘RND3’, this indicates that the battle group is currently in reserve and will arrive mid-battle. Do not set up reserve battle groups on the battlefield before the battle begins; instead, place them to one side. 

### 3. VICTORY CARD

The card drawn from the victory deck determines how the winner of the battle is chosen, and how long the battle will last. If the victory card instructs the players to determine who is the attacker and who is the defender, to place any objective markers or treasure tokens, or to do anything else before the battle begins, this is done in this step. 

#### Objectives and Treasure 
Sometimes the victory deck will require the place objectives or treasure on the battlefield. To do so, place an objective marker or treasure token at the indicated location. 

When measuring distances to objectives and treasure, always measure to and from the centre of the marker or token. 

#### TIED GAMES 
When the battle ends, if neither player has achieved the victory conditions on the victory card, the battle continues for another battle round before ending. Check the victory conditions once more to see if one of the players is declared the winner. If neither player has achieved the victory conditions, keep playing further battle rounds until all the fighters left on the battlefield are from one player’s warband – that player is declared the winner. 

### 4. TWIST CARD

The card drawn from the twist deck has a special rule that applies to that battle. 

## THE BATTLE BEGINS 
With the battlefield and warbands set up, and the battleplan decided, the players are now ready to begin the battle.
