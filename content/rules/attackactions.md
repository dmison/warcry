# ATTACK ACTION

> Some warriors fight with unrestrained ferocity, hacking at their foes until they are little more than bloody chunks of meat. Others dance through battle with preternatural grace, opening throats and piercing hearts with every strike.

On every fighter card there will be 1 or more weapons that the fighter can use when making an attack action. Each weapon has 4 characteristics: the Range characteristic, the Attacks characteristic, the  Strength characteristic and the Damage characteristic.

Sometimes a rule will refer to a characteristic of an attack action (for example, the Attacks characteristic of an attack action). This is simply an alternative way of referring to the corresponding characteristic of the weapon being used to make that attack action, but only for the duration of that attack action.

To make an attack action with a fighter, follow these 4 steps:

1. Pick a weapon & target
2. Roll to hit
3. Allocate damage
4. Remove takedown fighters

## PICK A WEAPON AND TARGET 

First, you must pick a weapon from the fighter card of the fighter making the attack action, and a visible enemy fighter to be the target of the attack action.

If there are any enemy fighters within 1" of the fighter making the attack action, one of those enemy fighters must be picked to be the target, and the weapon used cannot have a minimum range (see right).

If there are no enemy fighters within 1" of the fighter making the attack action, you can pick any enemy fighter to be the target as long as they are within range of the weapon that will be used.

### RANGE 

The range of a weapon is a number of inches equal to its Range characteristic. For example if a weapon has a Range characteristic of 3, an enemy fighter within 3" of the fighter making the attack action can be targeted by attack actions using that weapon (see Measuring Distances, pg 35). Some weapons have a minimum range, which means that they cannot be used to target fighters that are within a certain range. For example, a weapon that has a Range characteristic of 6-20 can target a fighter within 20", but not if that fighter is within 6".

## ROLL TO HIT 

Roll a number of dice equal to the Attacks characteristic of the weapon being used to make the attack action. This is referred to as the hit roll.
   
Next, you will need to determine which of the dice have missed, which have scored a hit and which have scored a critical hit. To do so, compare the Strength characteristic of the weapon being used for that attack action with the Toughness characteristic of the enemy fighter targeted by the attack action and consult the table below.

| STRENGTH VS TOUGHNESS | HIT | CRITICAL HIT |
| :-------------------- | :-: | :-: |
| Strength is greater than Toughness | 3-5 | 6 |
| Strength is equal to Toughness | 4-5 | 6 |
| Strength is lower than Toughness | 5-6 | 6 |

## ALLOCATE DAMAGE 
   
The Damage characteristic of each weapon has 2 values (divided by a ‘/’). These dictate how many damage points are allocated to the enemy fighter targeted by that attack action. For each hit, allocate a number of damage points equal to the first value of the Damage characteristic For each critical hit, allocate a number of damage points equal to the second value of the Damage characteristic, instead of the first.
   
For example, if a weapon with a Damage characteristic of 1/3 scored 2 hits, 1 critical hit and 1 miss, the total number of damage points allocated to the target fighter of that attack action would be 5 (1+1+3+0).

## REMOVE TAKEN DOWN FIGHTERS

Damage points are allocated one at a time. If the number of damage points allocated to a fighter equals its Wounds characteristic, that fighter is said to be taken down. Place a taken down fighter to one side – they are removed from the battlefield. A taken down fighter takes no further part in the battle – they cannot be activated, cannot make actions and cannot use abilities.

When a fighter is taken down any left over damage points from the attack action are discarded.
