<p>A Warcry battle is fought in a series of rounds referred to as battle rounds, each of which is split into three phases: the hero phase, the reserve phase and the combat phase. Once all phases have finished, a new battle round begins. The victory card will dictate after which battle round the battle ends. </p>
<p>BATTLE ROUND SEQUENCE </p>
<ol>
<li>HERO PHASE
Players determine who has the initiative during that battle round, and then decide how to use their wild dice. </li>
<li>RESERVE PHASE
In battle rounds after the reserve fighters may arrive on the battlefield. </li>
<li>COMBAT PHASE Players take it in turns to activate the fighters in their warband </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hero-phase"><a href="#hero-phase" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>HERO PHASE</h2>
<p>At the start of the hero phase, each player rolls 6 dice. These dice are referred to as initiative dice. After rolling the initiative dice, each player counts any singles. A single is a dice that does not have a matching score on any other dice in that playerâ€™s roll. The player with the most singles has the initiative. In the case of a tie, the players roll off and the winner has the initiative. </p>
<p>The remaining dice are referred to as ability dice, and can be used to perform abilities in the combat phase (see opposite). If 2 of your ability dice have the same score, it is referred to as a [double]. If 3 of your ability dice have the same score, it is referred to as a [triple]. Finally, if 4 or more of your ability dice have the same score, it is referred to as a [quad]. </p>
<p>At the start of each battle round, any remaining singles and ability dice from the previous battle round are discarded. </p>
<h3 id="wild-dice"><a href="#wild-dice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>WILD DICE</h3>
<p>After the initiative has been determined, each player receives 1 wild dice. A wild dice is an extra dice that can be used during the hero phase to add to either a playerâ€™s singles or ability dice.
The player with the initiative first declares how they will use any of their wild dice, followed by the player who does not have the initiative. Wild dice can be used in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>A wild dice can be used to add 1 to the number of singles the player has. In this case, it does not matter what the value of the wild dice is. Any number of wild dice can be used in this way. </li>
<li>A wild dice can be used to turn 1 of your singles into a [double], to improve a [double] to a [triple], or to improve a [triple] to a [quad]. In this case, the value of the wild dice is set to match the value of the single or ability dice it is paired with. You cannot add multiple wild dice to the same single or same ability dice (e.g. to turn a
[double] into a [quad]). </li>
</ul>
<p>Each wild dice can only be used once per battle. Wild dice that are not used in a battle round can be used in a subsequent battle round instead. </p>
<h3 id="seizing-the-initiative"><a href="#seizing-the-initiative" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>SEIZING THE INITIATIVE</h3>
<p>Once both players have declared any wild dice they will use this battle round, count the number of singles each player has once more. If the player without the initiative now has more singles than the player with the initiative, they now have the initiative instead. If the number of singles each player has is now tied (and wbattleforundas not previously), the players roll off and the winner has the initiative. </p>
<h2 id="reserve-phase"><a href="#reserve-phase" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>RESERVE PHASE</h2>
<p>The reserve phase comes into play in battle rounds after the first. During the reserve phase, reserve battle groups (pg 37) may be set up on the battlefield. The deployment card will indicate in which battle round any reserve battle groups come into play: â€˜RND2â€™ indicates that battle group will arrive in the reserve phase of the second battle round, and â€˜RND3â€™ indicates it will arrive in the reserve phase of the third battle round. </p>
<p>Starting with the player with the initiative, players set up the fighters from any battle groups coming into play in that battle round wholly within 3" horizontally, but any distance vertically, of their deployment point. </p>
<p>Some deployment cards have reserve deployment points that are situated off the battlefield map. In these cases, there will be a deployment line next to that deployment point. Deployment lines are either the length of half a battlefield edge or the length of a whole battlefield edge. If the deployment point is next to a deployment line, the battle group coming into play in that battle round must be set up wholly within 3" horizontally of that deployment line. </p>
<p>If it is ever impossible to set up all the fighters from a reserve battle group (for example, due to the positions of other fighters), each fighter from that battle group must be set up one at a time, as close as possible to either their deployment point (if it is on the battlefield map) or their deployment line. </p>
<h2 id="combat-phase"><a href="#combat-phase" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>COMBAT PHASE</h2>
<p>In the combat phase, the players take it in turns to activate their fighters. The player with the initiative picks which player takes the first turn. </p>
<p>When it is a playerâ€™s turn, they can activate one fighter in their warband. This is referred to as that fighterâ€™s activation. The player must pick 1 fighter to activate if they can, but cannot pick a fighter that has already activated this phase. If the player cannot pick a fighter (for example,
if all their fighters have already activated this phase), they must pass instead. Then their opponent can activate 1 fighter or pass. Keep on taking turns to activate fighters until both players pass one after the other. </p>
<h3 id="actions"><a href="#actions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>ACTIONS</h3>
<p>When a player activates a fighter, that fighter makes 2 actions chosen from the list below. Carry out the first action before deciding on the second. A fighter can make the same action twice in a row if you wish (for example, a move action followed by a move action). </p>
<ul>
<li>MOVE </li>
<li>ATTACK </li>
<li>DISENGAGE </li>
<li>WAIT </li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these actions is explained in detail over the following pages. </p>
