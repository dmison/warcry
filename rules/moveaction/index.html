Every fighter has a Move characteristic, which is shown on their fighter card. This determines the number of inches a fighter can move in total in a single move action.\n\n\u003E When a fighter makes a move action, there are 4 types of move they can make: normal moves, jumping, climbing and flying. A fighter can use these types of move in any combination as part of a single move action, so long as the total distance in inches moved does not exceed the fighter’s Move characteristic.\n\n\u003E The distance a fighter moves is measured using the part of the fighter’s base that moves furthest from its starting position (including pivoting).\n\n\u003E There are general limitations that must be adhered to when making a move action:\n\n\u003E - A fighter cannot move through other fighters.  \n\u003E - A fighter cannot move through any part of a terrain feature.  \n\u003E - No part of a fighter can ever move over the battlefield edge.  \n\u003E - If a fighter is within 1\" of any enemy fighters when they start a move action, they must finish that move action at least as close (or closer) to the enemy fighter that was nearest to them at the start of the move action. If there were 2 or more enemy fighters equally near to the fighter making the move action, the fighter must finish that move action at least as close (or closer) to all of them.\n\n## Disallowed Moves\n\n\u003E If a fighter’s move causes them to break one of the limitations of move actions, it is referred to as a ‘disallowed move’. For example, if a fighter jumped and the vertical distance moved downwards caused them to pass through another fighter, this is a disallowed move.\n\n\u003E Fighters cannot make disallowed moves. If one occurs during a move action, place the fighter making the move action back at their starting position and choose a new direction for them to move. Remember – as players are allowed to pre-measure any distances, you can plan your move action ahead to make sure it is not a disallowed move.\n\n\n## NORMAL MOVES\n\u003E A fighter can make a normal move if the centre of their base is on the battlefield floor or on a platform (pg 46). When a fighter moves normally, the centre of their base must remain on the battlefield floor or a platform at all times, unless they are moving over low terrain  (see below).\n\n## JUMPING\n\u003E A fighter that is on the battlefield can jump. If they do so, the fighter can move in a straight line horizontally through the air, and any distance vertically downwards through the air.\n\n\u003E Count the horizontal distance moved towards the number of inches that fighter can move in total in that move action as normal, but do not count the distance moved vertically downwards. However, each time the fighter moves 3\" or more vertically downwards when jumping, they suffer impact damage (see opposite).\n\n\u003E If a fighter finishes their move action in the air, immediately move them vertically downwards until a part of their base is either on or touching part of a terrain feature or the battlefield floor. If the fighter moves 3\" or more vertically downwards in this manner, they suffer impact damage (see opposite).\n\n## FLYING \n\n\u003E Fighters with the \u003CRunemark mark=\"Fly\" \u002F\u003E runemark can fly as part of a move action. If they do so, the fighter can move through the air vertically and horizontally. Count the horizontal distance moved towards the number of inches that fighter can move in total in that move action as normal, but do not count the distance moved vertically. Once a fighter begins to fly, they are said to be flying until the centre of their base is on the battlefield floor or a platform. A fighter cannot end a move action flying.\n\n## CLIMBING\n\n\u003E If a fighter is touching a part of a terrain feature defined as an obstacle (pg 46), that fighter can begin to climb. If they do so, that fighter can move vertically up or down that terrain feature (and also horizontally once at the top). Once a fighter begins to climb, they are said to be climbing until the centre of their base is on the battlefield floor or a platform.\n\n\u003E Fighters with the \u003CRunemark mark=\"Mount\" \u002F\u003E runemark cannot climb.\n\n## Falling\n\n\u003E There are a few situations that can cause a fighter to fall.\n\n\u003E Firstly, if a fighter finishes a move action with the centre of their base not on either the battlefield floor or on a platform and that fighter is not climbing (see right), that fighter is said to have fallen.\n\n\u003E Secondly, if a fighter is climbing when that fighter’s activation finishes, that fighter is said to have fallen.\n\n\u003E Lastly, fighters can fall as a result of being attacked near the edge of a platform (pg 46).\n\n\u003E If a fighter is said to have fallen, the opposing player picks a point on a platform or the battlefield floor that is within 2\" horizontally of the fighter that has fallen and is vertically lower. The fallen fighter is then placed with the centre of their base on that point. The player cannot pick a point that would cause the fallen fighter to be placed on or through another fighter or through a terrain feature. If it is impossible not to do so, and the centre of the base of the fallen fighter is on a platform, they remain where they are. If the centre of the base of the fallen fighter is not on a platform, they are immediately taken down (pg 44) instead.\n\n\u003E If the fallen fighter is now 3\" or more vertically lower than their location before they fell, that fighter suffers impact damage.\n\n## MOVE ACTIONS WITH MONSTERS\n\u003E A monster can climb and jump like any other fighter; however,  if at the end of a move action, its base is not wholly on a platform or the battlefield floor, it is said to have fallen.\n\n\u003E If a monster is said to have fallen, any part of the model's base can b e placed on the point picked by your opponent instead of just the centre.\n\n## Impact Damage\n\u003E If a fighter suffers impact damage, roll a dice. On a 4-5, allocate 1 damage point to that fighter (pg 44). On a 6, allocate 3 damage points to that fighter.\n\n## Moving Over Low Terrain\n\n\u003E When fighters make a normal move, they can move without penalty over a part of a terrain feature that extends vertically 1\" high or less off the battlefield floor or the platform upon which it is placed. This means that any vertical distance moved while moving over such a part of a terrain feature does not count against the total number of inches fighters can move in that move action.\n\n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[{"book":"Warcry Core Rules","page":"41,42"}],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"MOVE ACTION","anchor":"#move-action"},{"depth":2,"value":"Disallowed Moves","anchor":"#disallowed-moves"},{"depth":2,"value":"NORMAL MOVES","anchor":"#normal-moves"},{"depth":2,"value":"JUMPING","anchor":"#jumping"},{"depth":2,"value":"FLYING","anchor":"#flying"},{"depth":2,"value":"CLIMBING","anchor":"#climbing"},{"depth":2,"value":"Falling","anchor":"#falling"},{"depth":2,"value":"MOVE ACTIONS WITH MONSTERS","anchor":"#move-actions-with-monsters"},{"depth":2,"value":"Impact Damage","anchor":"#impact-damage"},{"depth":2,"value":"Moving Over Low Terrain","anchor":"#moving-over-low-terrain"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fwarbandroster\u002F","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fwaitaction\u002F","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Ftrialofchampions\u002F","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fthralls\u002F","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fterrain\u002F","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fsetup\u002F","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fopenplayterrain\u002F","title":"Open Play Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fmoveaction\u002F","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fheroesallies\u002F","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fmonsters\u002F","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002F","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Flesserartefacts\u002F","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fattackactions\u002F","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fgeneral\u002F","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Ffightercards\u002F","title":"Fighter Cards"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Ffatedquests\u002F","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fdisengageaction\u002F","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fchaoticbeasts\u002F","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fchallengebattles\u002F","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaignbattles\u002F","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaigns\u002F","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaignquests\u002F","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fbattleround\u002F","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Faftermath\u002F","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fabilities\u002F","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}};(function(){var s;(s=document.currentScript||document.scripts[document.scripts.length-1]).parentNode.removeChild(s);}());</script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/app.b57ad926.js" defer></script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/page--src--templates--markdown-page-vue.dba0067c.js" defer></script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/vue-remark--content--rules--moveaction-md.d969511c.js" defer></script>
