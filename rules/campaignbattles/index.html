You can challenge any player to a campaign battle if they too have chosen a campaign quest and filled out a warband roster. Both players must agree to playing a campaign battle instead of a normal battle.\n\n\u003E To play a campaign battle, players use the core rules for setting up a battle (pg 36-37) with the following amendments:\n\n\u003E - When mustering a warband for the battle, all fighters chosen must be taken from your warband roster.\n\u003E - Players may be able to muster more than 1000 points of fighters if they have dominated territory or have spent glory points on reinforcements (pg 66).\n\u003E - After playing the battle, both players must complete the aftermath sequence (pg 66-70).\n\n## CONVERGENCES\n\n\u003E Each campaign quest includes three unique campaign battles referred to as convergences. On the campaign progress tracker of your warband roster there are three map points marked as the first convergence, the second convergence and  the final convergence. Each of these map points is referred to as a convergence map point, and corresponds to a convergence on your campaign quest.  When a player’s warband is on a convergence map point, that warband must play the corresponding convergence and be victorious to advance further along the campaign progress tracker. The next time the player controlling that warband plays a campaign battle, they can ask their opponent if they would like to play through their convergence.  Each convergence has unique rules to follow when generating the battleplan. If both players’ warbands are on convergence map points, the players will have to decide which convergence they will play through. Only 1 player’s warband can play through their convergence, even if both warbands are embarked upon the same campaign quest and have reached the same convergence map point.\n\n\u003E In a convergence battle, the warband whose convergence the players are playing through is referred to as the Aspirant warband. Their opponent’s is referred to as the Adversary warband. To play through the convergence, use the guidelines for campaign battles to the left but generate the battleplan according to the corresponding convergence on the campaign quest. This means you might know some of the battleplan cards in play before you muster your warband – use this knowledge to your advantage!\n\n### DECISIVE BATTLES\n\n\u003E If the Aspirant warband loses the convergence, they must play through it again and win the battle before they can advance to the next map point on their campaign progress tracker. The next time the convergence is played through, it can be against the same opponent or a new opponent.\n\n### SPOILS OF WAR\n\n\u003E The player controlling the Adversary warband gets to make an additional search for lesser artefacts in the aftermath sequence after a convergence (pg 67).\n\n### THE NARRATIVE OF CONVERGENCES\n\n\u003E For the Aspirant warband, a convergence represents a pivotal moment in their quest. Success or failure balances on the edge of a blade, with only the Adversary warband standing between them and their goal. To build up the drama and tension of the battle to come, it is recommended that the player controlling the Aspirant warband reads aloud the introductory narrative to the convergence, and also tells the tale of the campaign quest their warband is embarked upon and the key events that have happened so far.\n\n\u003E For the player controlling the Adversary warband, playing through the convergence offers not only a chance to earn some extra treasure, but also lets you interact with the world of the Eightpoints as the fighters of your warband take on a new role, such as becoming the hired swords to a Chaos warlord or ambushers springing a trap.
