Fighters can interact with terrain features in numerous ways when making move actions (pg 41). This section introduces the other interactions fighters can have with terrain features, and also describes the unique types of terrain features. \n\nTerrain features come in many shapes and sizes. When a rule refers to a terrain feature, it refers to the scenery model itself and any base it is mounted upon, but not any empty space around or within it. \n\n## OBSTACLES \n\nSome terrain features, or some parts of terrain features, can be defined as an obstacle. An obstacle is any part of a terrain feature that prevents a fighter from moving horizontally and that extends vertically more than 1\"  high from the battlefield floor or the platform upon which it is placed. \n\nThe target fighter of an attack action receives the benefit of cover if an imaginary line drawn between the closest points on each fighter’s base passes through an obstacle. However, if the fighters are more than 1\" away from each other, do not count parts of obstacles within 1⁄2\" of the fighter making the attack action (this represents fighters that have weapons with a longer range being able to aim around corners, through gaps in nearby terrain, and so on). \n\n## Cover \n\nIf a fighter receives the benefit of cover when targeted by an attack action, add 1 to their Toughness characteristic for that attack action. \n\n## PLATFORMS \n\nSome terrain features, or some parts of a terrain feature, can be defined as a platform. A platform is a horizontally flat surface on a terrain feature with a surface area larger than 1\" by 1\", that is raised 1\" or higher above the battlefield floor. \n\nWhen an attack action targets an enemy fighter that is on a platform, the target fighter of that attack action receives the benefit of cover if the fighter making the attack action is 3\" or more vertically below the target fighter. \n\n### FALLING OFF TERRAIN \n\nWhen an attack action targets an enemy fighter that is within 1⁄2\" of the edge of a platform that is open (i.e. an edge that is not enclosed by an obstacle, such as a wall) and scores any critical hits, the target fighter of that attack must take a falling test after the attack action has been resolved. To do so, the player controlling that fighter rolls a dice. On a 1, the fighter is said to have fallen (pg 42). \n\nThis rule does not affect fighters with the \u003CRunemark mark=\"Fly\" \u002F\u003E runemark. \n\n## DEADLY TERRAIN \n\nSome terrain features, or parts of terrain features, are said to be deadly terrain. If you are using the terrain that comes with Warcry, you can see which parts of those terrain features are deadly terrain on page 46. \n\nIf you are using other terrain features, you should agree with your opponent which parts of those terrain features are deadly terrain when the battlefield is first set up. Parts of terrain features that are deadly terrain can still be platforms or obstacles if they fall under the definitions of either. \n\nIf a fighter ever moves onto deadly terrain, for example, if they begin to climb deadly terrain or finish a jump upon deadly terrain, they immediately suffer impact damage (pg 42). In addition, if a fallen fighter (pg 42) is placed within 1\" of deadly terrain, they immediately suffer impact damage. \n\nNote, it is possible for a fighter to suffer impact damage more than once due to deadly terrain. For example, if a fallen fighter is placed within 1\" of deadly terrain and is now 3\" or more vertically lower than their location before they fell, that fighter would suffer impact damage twice (and would therefore make 2 dice rolls). \n\n## STAIRS AND LADDERS \n\nSome terrain features, or parts of terrain features, are said to be stairs or ladders. You can see an example of stairs on page 46. Stairs and ladders are treated as obstacles, with the following exceptions: \n\n- Fighters that finish their activation climbing stairs or a ladder are not said to have fallen and can remain part way up stairs or a ladder (if it is not possible to physically place the fighter in their current location, make a note of where they are).  \n- When an attack action targets an enemy fighter that has ended their activation climbing stairs or a ladder and scores any critical hits, the target fighter must take a falling test (pg 46) after the attack action has been resolved.  \n\n## ARCHWAYS AND DOORS \n\nSome terrain features, or parts of terrain features, are said to be archways or doors. If you are using the terrain that comes with Warcry, you can see which parts of those terrain features are archways or doors on page 46. \n\nIf you are using other terrain features, you should agree with your opponent which parts of those terrain features are either archways or doors when the battlefield is first set up. Archways and doors can still be platforms or obstacles if they fall under the definitions of either (usually they will be obstacles, but something like a trapdoor could be part of a platform). \n\nAs part of a move action, if a fighter is touching a part of a terrain feature defined as an archway or a door, that fighter can make a normal move through it even if the miniature or its base is too large to physically fit through (or it is blocked completely, as in the case of a closed door). This is an exception to the rule which states that a fighter cannot move through any part of a terrain feature. \n\nTo move through an archway or a door, first measure the distance in a straight line through the horizontal centre of the archway or doorway. If the fighter has sufficient movement to pass through the archway or door and be placed on the other side, they can move through it. \n\nWhen fighters move through archways and doors, all other movement rules must still be followed (for example, they cannot move through another fighter). \n\n### RESTRICTIONS \n\nFighters with any of the following runemarks cannot move through archways: \n\n- \u003CRunemark mark=\"Gargantuan\" \u002F\u003E\n- \u003CRunemark mark=\"Mount\" \u002F\u003E \n\nFighters with any of the following runemarks cannot move through doors: \n\n- \u003CRunemark mark=\"Gargantuan\" \u002F\u003E\n- \u003CRunemark mark=\"Mount\" \u002F\u003E\n- \u003CRunemark mark=\"Beast\" \u002F\u003E \n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"TERRAIN","anchor":"#terrain"},{"depth":2,"value":"OBSTACLES","anchor":"#obstacles"},{"depth":2,"value":"Cover","anchor":"#cover"},{"depth":2,"value":"PLATFORMS","anchor":"#platforms"},{"depth":3,"value":"FALLING OFF TERRAIN","anchor":"#falling-off-terrain"},{"depth":2,"value":"DEADLY TERRAIN","anchor":"#deadly-terrain"},{"depth":2,"value":"STAIRS AND LADDERS","anchor":"#stairs-and-ladders"},{"depth":2,"value":"ARCHWAYS AND DOORS","anchor":"#archways-and-doors"},{"depth":3,"value":"RESTRICTIONS","anchor":"#restrictions"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fwarbandroster\u002F","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fwaitaction\u002F","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Ftrialofchampions\u002F","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fthralls\u002F","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fterrain\u002F","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fsetup\u002F","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fmoveaction\u002F","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fmonsters\u002F","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Flesserartefacts\u002F","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002F","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fdisengageaction\u002F","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Ffatedquests\u002F","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fheroesallies\u002F","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fgeneral\u002F","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fchallengebattles\u002F","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fchaoticbeasts\u002F","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaigns\u002F","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaignquests\u002F","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaignbattles\u002F","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fbattleround\u002F","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Faftermath\u002F","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fattackactions\u002F","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fabilities\u002F","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}};(function(){var s;(s=document.currentScript||document.scripts[document.scripts.length-1]).parentNode.removeChild(s);}());</script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/app.5c9cbb51.js" defer></script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/page--src--templates--markdown-page-vue.9af9fac4.js" defer></script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/vue-remark--content--rules--terrain-md.eb66010c.js" defer></script>
