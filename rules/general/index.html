A `re-roll` allows you to take on or more of the dice that you just rolled and roll them again.  Rules which allow `re-rolls` will specify exactly how many of the dice can be re-rolled. A dice roll can never be `re-rolled` more than once.\n\n## ROLL-OFFS\n\n\u003E Sometimes a rule may require the players to make a roll-off. When this is the case, each of the players rolls a dice, and whoever rolls highest wins the roll-off. If there is a tie for the highest roll, make the roll-off again.\n\n## MEASURING DISTANCES\n\n\u003E Distances in Warcry are measured in inches (\"), between the closest points of the bases of the fighters you’re measuring to and from. If a rule requires something to be within a certain range of something else, they are considered to be within if the distance between them is equal to or less than the specified distance. If a rule requires a fighter to be wholly within, every part of that fighter’s base must be within range.\n\n\u003E Usually, measuring distances will take into account both the vertical and horizontal distance between two models, but in some cases, a rule might specify that only the horizontal distance or only the vertical distance is measured.\n\n\u003EWhen a rule requires you to measure the vertical distance only, the distance is rounded up to the nearest half inch. For example, if the vertical distance between two points is 2.6\" and a rule requires you to measure the vertical distance between those points, the points would be considered to be 3\" apart for the purpose of that rule. Note that distances are only rounded up in this manner and never rounded down.\n\n\u003E You can measure distances whenever you wish.\n\n## VISIBILITY\n\n\u003E Many rules in Warcry require one fighter (usually the target of an attack action or ability) to be visible to another fighter (usually the fighter making the attack action or using the ability).\n\n\u003E One fighter is said to be visible to another fighter if a direct line could be drawn between the two fighters without passing through a terrain feature or another fighter.\n\n\u003E If you are unsure whether a fighter is visible, stoop down behind the fighter making the attack action or using the ability to see if any part of the target fighter is visible from any part of the fighter making the attack action.\n\n\u003E When checking to see if two fighters are visible to each other, do not include either of the bases each fighter is mounted upon.\n\n## FRIENDLY AND ENEMY FIGHTERS\n\n\u003E A player considers all fighters in their warband to be friendly fighters and all fighters in other warbands to be enemy fighters. Likewise, a fighter considers all other fighters in their warband to be friendly fighters, and all fighters in other warbands to be enemy fighters.\n\n\u003E If a rule for an action or ability performed by a fighter refers to ‘other friendly fighters’, it means fighters from that fighter’s warband, excluding itself.\n\n## RUNEMARKS\n\n\u003E In Warcry, many rules interact with the runemarks on each fighter card. For example a fighter’s faction is determined by their faction runemark. Certain abilities require a fighter to have certain runemarks for that fighter to be able to use them, and other runemarks give fighters access to special rules, such as being able to fly.\n\n\u003E You can find a list of the different runemarks on pages 50-51.\n\n## LEADERS\n\n\u003E In every warband there will be one fighter with the \u003CRunemark mark=\"leader\" \u002F\u003E runemark. If a rule refers to the leader of a warband, it is referring to the fighter with that runemark.\n\n## SEQUENCING\n\n\u003E In most cases rules will be resolved one at a time. However, from time to time, rules may appear to come into play at the same time and it may be unclear as to which is resolved first. If this occurs in the combat phase, the player whose turn it is to activate a fighter chooses the order in which the rules are resolved; in any other phase, the player with the initiative chooses. In any other case, the players roll off and the winner chooses.\n\n## CONTROLLING OBJECTIVES \n\u003E A player gains control of an objective if, at the end of a battle round, they have more friendly fighters within 3\" of it than there are enemy fighters within 3\" of it. Once a player gains control of an objective, it remains under their control until another player gains control of it. \n\n\n## CARRYING TREASURE\n\n\u003E If, at any point when making a move action, a fighter moves within 1\" of a treasure token, the player can choose for that fighter to pick up that treasure. Remove the token from the battlefield. That fighter is now said to be carrying that treasure. A fighter cannot pick up treasure if they are already carrying treasure. \n\n\u003E A fighter carrying treasure can use an action to drop the treasure (see page 39 for rules on actions). If a fighter carrying treasure is taken down (pg 44), they automatically drop the treasure before the fighter’s model is removed from play. In both cases, the player controlling that fighter picks a point on a platform or the battlefield floor that is within 1\" horizontally of the fighter, visible to the fighter and either vertically level to or any distance vertically lower than the fighter, and places the treasure token there. \n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[{"book":"Warcry Core Rules","page":"35, 37, 40"},{"book":"ERRATA & DESIGNERS’ COMMENTARIES March 2021","page":"1"}],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"GENERAL RULES","anchor":"#general-rules"},{"depth":2,"value":"RE-ROLLS","anchor":"#re-rolls"},{"depth":2,"value":"ROLL-OFFS","anchor":"#roll-offs"},{"depth":2,"value":"MEASURING DISTANCES","anchor":"#measuring-distances"},{"depth":2,"value":"VISIBILITY","anchor":"#visibility"},{"depth":2,"value":"FRIENDLY AND ENEMY FIGHTERS","anchor":"#friendly-and-enemy-fighters"},{"depth":2,"value":"RUNEMARKS","anchor":"#runemarks"},{"depth":2,"value":"LEADERS","anchor":"#leaders"},{"depth":2,"value":"SEQUENCING","anchor":"#sequencing"},{"depth":2,"value":"CONTROLLING OBJECTIVES","anchor":"#controlling-objectives"},{"depth":2,"value":"CARRYING TREASURE","anchor":"#carrying-treasure"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fwarbandroster\u002F","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fwaitaction\u002F","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Ftrialofchampions\u002F","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fthralls\u002F","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fterrain\u002F","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fsetup\u002F","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fopenplayterrain\u002F","title":"Open Play Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Flesserartefacts\u002F","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fmoveaction\u002F","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fmonsters\u002F","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002F","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fheroesallies\u002F","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fgeneral\u002F","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fdisengageaction\u002F","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Ffatedquests\u002F","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fchaoticbeasts\u002F","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fchallengebattles\u002F","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaigns\u002F","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaignquests\u002F","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fcampaignbattles\u002F","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fbattleround\u002F","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fattackactions\u002F","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Faftermath\u002F","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"\u002Frules\u002Fabilities\u002F","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}};(function(){var s;(s=document.currentScript||document.scripts[document.scripts.length-1]).parentNode.removeChild(s);}());</script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/app.11474d15.js" defer></script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/page--src--templates--markdown-page-vue.dba0067c.js" defer></script><script src="/warcry/assets/js/vue-remark--content--rules--general-md.3f44dc88.js" defer></script>
