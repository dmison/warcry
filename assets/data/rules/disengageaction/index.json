When a fighter makes a disengage action, that fighter can make a normal move (pg 41) up to 3\" in any direction but must finish the action more than 1\" away from any enemy fighters. If this is impossible, the fighter cannot use the disengage action and must use another action instead.\n\n## Disengage Actions vs Move Actions\n\n> Although the position of a fighter changes as part of a disengage action, it is not considered to be a move action in any way. This means any abilities or rules that interact specifically with move actions do not interact with disengage actions. In addition, a fighter cannot jump, climb or fly as part of a disengage action. \n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[{"book":"Warcry Core Rules","page":"45"}],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"DISENGAGE ACTION","anchor":"#disengage-action"},{"depth":2,"value":"Disengage Actions vs Move Actions","anchor":"#disengage-actions-vs-move-actions"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/openplayterrain/","title":"Open Play Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
