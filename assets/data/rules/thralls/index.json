This is usually in a campaign battle (pg 63) when a warband’s territory rules allow them to do so, but there are also other ways of including thralls in a warband (for example, the Sinister Bargain twist card allows a player to include 1 thrall in their warband).\n\nIf a player is allowed to include any thralls in their warband, they can choose any fighter with the <Runemark mark=\"Chaotic Beast\" /> faction runemark that has the <Runemark mark=\"thrall\" /> runemark  to become their thrall, and include that fighter in their warband for that battle. Thralls are ignored for the purposes of the rule that requires fighters in a warband to all share the same faction runemark.\n\nWhen a chaotic beast is chosen to become a thrall, it is no longer subject to the Territorial Predators or the Bestial Intellects rules, and is instead treated as a friendly fighter in that player’s warband.\n\nWhen a player activates a thrall in their warband, they can use any of their ability dice to use abilities with that thrall. A thrall can use the universal abilities (pg 40) and the abilities on their ability card. \n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"THRALLS","anchor":"#thralls"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
