This is usually in a campaign battle (pg 63) when a warband’s territory rules allow them to do so, but there are also other ways of including thralls in a warband (for example, the Sinister Bargain twist card allows a player to include 1 thrall in their warband).</p>\n<p>If a player is allowed to include any thralls in their warband, they can choose any fighter with the Chaotic Beast faction runemark ( ) that has the thrall runemark ( ) to become their thrall, and include that fighter in their warband for that battle.
