First, note down the campaign quest you have chosen, then fill in the other areas of player and warband information such as your warband’s name (you can draw inspiration from the many warbands mentioned in this book and others).\n\nThe warband roster has space for 1 leader/favoured warrior and 10 fighters. For a full 20-strong warband you will need two copies of this page.\n\n## ADDING FIGHTERS\n\nThe next step in completing your warband roster is to add fighters to it. Your warband roster is the pool of fighters from which you will pick up to 15 when mustering your warband for a campaign battle (see Playing a Campaign Battle, pg 65).\n\nBefore your first campaign battle, you can add up to 20 fighters to your warband roster. These fighters can total any number of points, but it should contain at least 1000 points’ worth of fighters to allow you to field a full warband during your first campaign battle. You do not have to add the full 20 fighters to begin with – you can instead choose to add additional fighters as the campaign progresses. You’ll be able to add and remove fighters from your warband roster after each campaign battle (pg 67). When adding fighters to your warband roster, you must adhere to the following restrictions:\n\n1.\tYour warband roster must include at least 3 fighters.\n2.\tYour warband roster cannot exceed 20 fighters.\n3.\tAll fighters added to your warband roster must share the same faction runemark as the campaign quest you have chosen.\n4.\tYour warband roster must include 1 fighter with the\n5.\t<Runemark mark=\"Leader\"/> runemark  and cannot include more than 1 fighter with the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\"/> runemark.\n\nOn pages 134-151 you can find background tables to help you personalise all the fighters in your warband.\n\n## CAMPAIGN PROGRESS TRACKER\n\nThe warband roster includes a campaign progress tracker. This tracks how close your warband is to completing the goal of their quest. There are 12 points on the campaign tracker referred to as map points. Your warband begins on the map point labelled ‘Start’. You can indicate the progress of your warband by marking the map point they have reached. You can find the rules for advancing map points on page 70.\n\n## PREPARING FOR YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN BATTLE\n\nWhen first filling out your warband roster, you can ignore the Lesser Artefacts, Artefacts of Power, Command Traits, Destiny Levels, Territories and Glory Points sections, as these only come into play after your first campaign battle.\n\n### ARTEFACTS AND COMMAND TRAITS\n\nEach fighter can be the bearer of 1 artefact of power and 1 lesser artefact. In addition, your leader can have 1 command trait. How to gain these is described on page 70.\n\n### DESTINY LEVELS\n\nEach fighter can gain up to 3 destiny levels. If a fighter gains a destiny level (pg 67) you can mark one of the icons to indicate so. During a campaign battle, if a fighter spends their destiny level, you can place a counter on it to indicate it is spent.\n\n### TERRITORIES\n\nYour warband can dominate up to six pieces of territory at any one time. The campaign quest you have chosen will detail how your warband can dominate territory and what effect territory has on your warband.\n\n### GLORY POINTS\n\nAfter a campaign battle, your warband will gain a number of glory points, which can be spent during the aftermath sequence (pg 66).\n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"WARBAND ROSTER","anchor":"#warband-roster"},{"depth":2,"value":"ADDING FIGHTERS","anchor":"#adding-fighters"},{"depth":2,"value":"CAMPAIGN PROGRESS TRACKER","anchor":"#campaign-progress-tracker"},{"depth":2,"value":"PREPARING FOR YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN BATTLE","anchor":"#preparing-for-your-first-campaign-battle"},{"depth":3,"value":"ARTEFACTS AND COMMAND TRAITS","anchor":"#artefacts-and-command-traits"},{"depth":3,"value":"DESTINY LEVELS","anchor":"#destiny-levels"},{"depth":3,"value":"TERRITORIES","anchor":"#territories"},{"depth":3,"value":"GLORY POINTS","anchor":"#glory-points"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
