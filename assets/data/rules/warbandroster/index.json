First, note down the campaign quest you have chosen, then fill in the other areas of player and warband information such as your warband’s name (you can draw inspiration from the many warbands mentioned in this book and others).</p>\n<p>The warband roster has space for 1 leader/favoured warrior and 10 fighters. For a full 20-strong warband you will need two copies of this page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adding-fighters\"><a href=\"#adding-fighters\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>ADDING FIGHTERS</h2>\n<p>The next step in completing your warband roster is to add fighters to it. Your warband roster is the pool of fighters from which you will pick up to 15 when mustering your warband for a campaign battle (see Playing a Campaign Battle, pg 65).</p>\n<p>Before your first campaign battle, you can add up to 20 fighters to your warband roster. These fighters can total any number of points, but it should contain at least 1000 points’ worth of fighters to allow you to field a full warband during your first campaign battle. You do not have to add the full 20 fighters to begin with – you can instead choose to add additional fighters as the campaign progresses. You’ll be able to add and remove fighters from your warband roster after each campaign battle (pg 67). When adding fighters to your warband roster, you must adhere to the following restrictions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your warband roster must include at least 3 fighters.</li>\n<li>Your warband roster cannot exceed 20 fighters.</li>\n<li>All fighters added to your warband roster must share the same faction runemark as the campaign quest you have chosen.</li>\n<li>Your warband roster must include 1 fighter with the</li>\n<li>Leader runemark ( ) and cannot include more than 1 fighter with the Leader runemark ( ).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On pages 134-151 you can find background tables to help you personalise all the fighters in your warband.</p>\n<h2 id=\"campaign-progress-tracker\"><a href=\"#campaign-progress-tracker\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>CAMPAIGN PROGRESS TRACKER</h2>\n<p>The warband roster includes a campaign progress tracker. This tracks how close your warband is to completing the goal of their quest. There are 12 points on the campaign tracker referred to as map points. Your warband begins on the map point labelled ‘Start’. You can indicate the progress of your warband by marking the map point they have reached. You can find the rules for advancing map points on page 70.</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparing-for-your-first-campaign-battle\"><a href=\"#preparing-for-your-first-campaign-battle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>PREPARING FOR YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN BATTLE</h2>\n<p>When first filling out your warband roster, you can ignore the Lesser Artefacts, Artefacts of Power, Command Traits, Destiny Levels, Territories and Glory Points sections, as these only come into play after your first campaign battle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"artefacts-and-command-traits\"><a href=\"#artefacts-and-command-traits\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>ARTEFACTS AND COMMAND TRAITS</h3>\n<p>Each fighter can be the bearer of 1 artefact of power and 1 lesser artefact. In addition, your leader can have 1 command trait. How to gain these is described on page 70.</p>\n<h3 id=\"destiny-levels\"><a href=\"#destiny-levels\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>DESTINY LEVELS</h3>\n<p>Each fighter can gain up to 3 destiny levels. If a fighter gains a destiny level (pg 67) you can mark one of the icons to indicate so. During a campaign battle, if a fighter spends their destiny level, you can place a counter on it to indicate it is spent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"territories\"><a href=\"#territories\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>TERRITORIES</h3>\n<p>Your warband can dominate up to six pieces of territory at any one time. The campaign quest you have chosen will detail how your warband can dominate territory and what effect territory has on your warband.</p>\n<h3 id=\"glory-points\"><a href=\"#glory-points\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>GLORY POINTS</h3>\n<p>After a campaign battle, your warband will gain a number of glory points, which can be spent during the aftermath sequence (pg 66).</p>\n","sidebar":"rules","headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"WARBAND ROSTER","anchor":"#warband-roster"},{"depth":2,"value":"ADDING FIGHTERS","anchor":"#adding-fighters"},{"depth":2,"value":"CAMPAIGN PROGRESS TRACKER","anchor":"#campaign-progress-tracker"},{"depth":2,"value":"PREPARING FOR YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN BATTLE","anchor":"#preparing-for-your-first-campaign-battle"},{"depth":3,"value":"ARTEFACTS AND COMMAND TRAITS","anchor":"#artefacts-and-command-traits"},{"depth":3,"value":"DESTINY LEVELS","anchor":"#destiny-levels"},{"depth":3,"value":"TERRITORIES","anchor":"#territories"},{"depth":3,"value":"GLORY POINTS","anchor":"#glory-points"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
