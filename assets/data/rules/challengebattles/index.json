Few of these tests are more perilous, however, than facing off against one of the savage beasts of the Eightpoints.\n</p>\n<cite slot=\"cite\">Tome of Champions</cite>\n</book-quote>\n\n# HOW TO PLAY A CHALLENGE BATTLE \n\n> When you challenge an opponent to a campaign battle, if both players agree, you can instead choose to play a challenge battle.\n\n> In a challenge battle, one player, known as the Challenger, is attempting to overcome the challenge that has been set. This player’s warband is known as the Challenger warband.\n\n> The other player, known as the Adversary player, is attempting to thwart the Challenger. Rather than controlling their own warband, the Adversary player instead controls fighters that are referred to as adversaries.\n\n> First, decide which challenge battle you will play, which player will be the Challenger and which player will be the Adversary player.\n\n> Each challenge battle has four sections: Set-up, Special Rules, Battleplan and The Spoils.\n\n## SET-UP\n\n> The Set-up section of a challenge battle details how the players muster their warbands. The Challenger and the Adversary player will have different rules they must follow.\n\n> In a challenge battle, dominated territories do not grant additional points to a warband and glory points cannot be spent on reinforcements.\n\n## ADVERSARIES\n\n> The Adversary player will have a unique pool of fighters to choose from in each challenge battle. This may be a single large monster or a group of fighters using fighter cards from existing factions. In either case, the fighters controlled by the Adversary player are never drawn from their warband roster, even if the same fighter card is used.\n\n> Adversaries do not have any destiny levels, artefacts or command traits unless it is specifically stated otherwise. In the aftermath sequence, the Adversary player does not make injury rolls for these fighters, nor do they roll for destiny levels for them.\n\n## THE PREREQUISITE AND THE STAKE\n\n> Every challenge battle has a prerequisite and a stake. The prerequisite is the required number of dominated territories that the Challenger warband must have.\n\n> If the Challenger warband does not meet the prerequisite, the challenge battle cannot be played.\n\n> If the Challenger warband loses the challenge battle, they immediately lose a number of dominated territories equal to the stake. This represents the repercussions that the warband faces in the wake of their failure and the time they must spend recuperating their resources.\n\n## SPECIAL RULES\n\n> Challenge battles may have 1 or more special rules. These can be rules that apply to some or all fighters – akin to twists – or rules that alter the core rules for generating a battle.\n\n## SHATTERED DOMINION OBJECTIVES\n\n> The challenge battles in Tome of Champions 2019 each use 1 of the following Shattered Dominion objectives (pictured left):\n\n> 1. Hallowed Tomb\n> 2. Ensorcelled Armoury\n> 3. Trove of Arcane Glory\n> 4. The Realms’ Ransom\n> 5. Realmvault Key\n> 6. Iconoclast Axe\n> 7. Soul Stone\n\n> The Special Rules section of each challenge battle states which Shattered Dominion objective is used and what rules it has during the battle.\n\n## BATTLEPLAN\n\n> The Battleplan section of each challenge battle explains how to generate the battleplan.\n\n## THE SPOILS\n\n> Each challenge battle has 1 or more spoils. If the Challenger warband wins the challenge battle, they receive 1 of the spoils of that challenge battle. If the number of spoils is greater than 1, the player must pick which they will receive.\n\n> Some spoils will let you add the monster adversary to your warband roster. If you choose such a spoil, use the rules on page 46 of Warcry: Monsters and Mercenaries.\n\n## THE AFTERMATH SEQUENCE\n\n> After each challenge battle, resolve the aftermath sequence (Core Book, pg 66-70) with the following amendments:\n\n> * Players do not receive glory points for playing a challenge battle.\n> * Injury rolls and destiny rolls are not made for adversaries.\n> * Neither player advances on their campaign progress tracker.\n\n> Note that both players can make 1 search roll on the lesser artefacts table as normal.\n\n## PLAYING AGAIN\n\n> Once you have emerged victorious in a challenge battle, you can record your achievement by checking  the appropriate box on your warband roster.\n\n> You can play through the same challenge battle as many times as you wish, even if you have already achieved victory. Note that certain spoils, such as artefacts of power, are limited to 1 per warband roster.\n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[{"book":"Tome of Champions 2019","page":"68"}],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"CHALLENGE BATTLES","anchor":"#challenge-battles"},{"depth":1,"value":"HOW TO PLAY A CHALLENGE BATTLE","anchor":"#how-to-play-a-challenge-battle"},{"depth":2,"value":"SET-UP","anchor":"#set-up"},{"depth":2,"value":"ADVERSARIES","anchor":"#adversaries"},{"depth":2,"value":"THE PREREQUISITE AND THE STAKE","anchor":"#the-prerequisite-and-the-stake"},{"depth":2,"value":"SPECIAL RULES","anchor":"#special-rules"},{"depth":2,"value":"SHATTERED DOMINION OBJECTIVES","anchor":"#shattered-dominion-objectives"},{"depth":2,"value":"BATTLEPLAN","anchor":"#battleplan"},{"depth":2,"value":"THE SPOILS","anchor":"#the-spoils"},{"depth":2,"value":"THE AFTERMATH SEQUENCE","anchor":"#the-aftermath-sequence"},{"depth":2,"value":"PLAYING AGAIN","anchor":"#playing-again"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/openplayterrain/","title":"Open Play Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
