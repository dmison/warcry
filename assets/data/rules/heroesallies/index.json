Many warbands seek to make alliances with powerful heroes and champions, for together they stand far greater chance of mastering the wilds than either does alone.</p>\n<cite slot=\"cite\">Grand Alliance Books</cite>\n</book-quote>\n\n> This section provides rules for a special types of fighters known as heroes and allies. These rules allow you to include more than 1 fighter with the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\" /> runemark in your warband, as well as fighters with a different faction runemark to your warband. This gives you even more ways to theme your warband and make it unique. \n\n> For example, your Stormcast Eternals might be accompanied by a mysterious emissary from an Idoneth Deepkin enclaw, or perhaps your Seraphon are led by a Sunblood who is advised by a cunning Skink Priest.\n \n> The rules in this sectton supersede the allies rules from the \"Warcry Monsters and Mercenaries\" book.\n\n## INCLUDING HEROES AND ALLIES IN YOUR WARBAND\n\n> Any fighter with the same faction runemark as your warband and the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\" /> runemark can be included in your warband as a hero.\n\n> Any fighter with a different faction runemark to your warband and either the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\" /> runemark or the Ally runemark can be induded in rour warband as an ally. \n\n> However, warbands can only include allies from the same Grand Alliance.\n\n> There are limits on how many heroes and allies; you can include in your warband, depending on the style of game you are playing.\n\n### OPEN AND MATCHED PLAY\n\n> In open play and matched play, when mustering for a battle, you\ncan include 1 hero or ally in your warband. Heroes and allies cost points just like any other fighter, but allies are ignored for the purpose of the rule that requires all fighters in a warband to share the same faction runemark. In addition, when mustering your warband, heroes and allies are not considered to have the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\" /> runemark.\n\n### NARRATIVE PLAY\n> In narrative play, heroes and allies can be added to your warband roster like any other fighter, either when you are first filling out your warband roster or during the Add and Remove Fighters step of the aftermath sequence.\n\n> Your warband roster can include up to 3 heroes or allies in any combination. When adding fighters to your warband roster, heroes and allies are not considered to have the Leader runcmark and do not count towards the maximum number of fighters you can add.\n\n> When mustering for a campaign battle, you can include 1 hero or ally from your warband roster for every 2 areas of territory your warband has dominated. \n\n> Heroes and allies cost points just hke any other fighter, but allies are ignored for the purposes of the rule that requires all fighters m a warband to share the same faction runemark. In addition, when mustering your warband, heroes and allies are not considered to have the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\" /> runemark ().\n\n> If your warband can include thralls when mustering for a campaign battle, any heroes or allies you include in your warband do not decrease the number of thralls you can include, and vice versa.\n\n> Like other fighters, heroes and allies can receive destiny levels, players must make injury rolls for them and they can bear lesser artefacts. Heroes can bear artefacts of power and be chosen to become favoured warriors, but allies cannot.\n\n## HEROES AND ALLIES NEVER LEAD\n\n> When a fighter is included in a warband as a hero or ally, if they have the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\" /> runemark on their fighter card, the runemark is only used to determine which abilities that fighter has.   The hero or allv is not  considered to have the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\" /> runemark for any other purpose or rule. This means that any rule that refers to the leader of a warband does not refer to heroes or allies in the warband.\n\n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[{"book":"Grand Alliance Books","page":"5"}],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"HEROES AND ALLIES","anchor":"#heroes-and-allies"},{"depth":2,"value":"INCLUDING HEROES AND ALLIES IN YOUR WARBAND","anchor":"#including-heroes-and-allies-in-your-warband"},{"depth":3,"value":"OPEN AND MATCHED PLAY","anchor":"#open-and-matched-play"},{"depth":3,"value":"NARRATIVE PLAY","anchor":"#narrative-play"},{"depth":2,"value":"HEROES AND ALLIES NEVER LEAD","anchor":"#heroes-and-allies-never-lead"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/openplayterrain/","title":"Open Play Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fightercards/","title":"Fighter Cards"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
