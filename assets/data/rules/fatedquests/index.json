Those who battle amidst the Bloodwind Spoil are no different, though each warlord’s story is defined by their choices and character.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this section you will find 4 special campaign quests known as fated quests. To use these quests, refer to page 63 of the Warcry Core Book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"paths-open-to-any-who-dare\"><a href=\"#paths-open-to-any-who-dare\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>PATHS OPEN TO ANY WHO DARE</h2>\n<p>Fated quests do not have a faction runemark. Instead, you can choose 1 faction runemark to apply to a fated quest. This means it can be embarked upon by a warband from any faction.</p>\n<p>In addition, individual fated quests do not have their own territory rules. Instead, the territory rules opposite are used by all warbands that embark upon a fated quest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fated-quest-territory-rules\"><a href=\"#fated-quest-territory-rules\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>FATED QUEST TERRITORY RULES</h2>\n<p>Dominate Territory: As the power of a warband grows, so too does the extent of territory it can lay claim to. Those serving the Dark Gods often raise imposing monoliths within their domain, whilst those of different allegiance display their might in myriad other ways.</p>\n<p>You can spend 10 glory points to dominate a territory. Mark on your warband roster how many territories you dominate. Dominating territory offers the following bonuses:</p>\n<p>Growing Power: For each territory dominated by your warband, increase the points you have available to spend on fighters when mustering your warband for a campaign battle by 50.</p>\n<p>Thralls: If your warband is from 1 of the following factions, for each territory dominated by your warband, you can include 1 thrall in your warband when mustering for a campaign battle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iron Golem</li>\n<li>Untamed Beasts</li>\n<li>Corvus Cabal</li>\n<li>The Unmade</li>\n<li>Cypher Lords</li>\n<li>Splintered Fang</li>\n<li>Spire Tyrants</li>\n<li>Scions of the Flame</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thralls included in this manner are not added to your warband roster, and cost points like any other fighter. Thralls can never gain destiny levels, bear artefacts or be chosen to become a favoured warrior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"honour-or-glory\"><a href=\"#honour-or-glory\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>HONOUR OR GLORY</h2>\n<p>Even the most noble champion may occasionally sully their soul in pursuit of glory, whilst a black-hearted rogue can reveal themselves to possess a shred of honour – albeit only if it benefits them to show it. In the corrupted lands of the Eightpoints it is a warrior’s deeds alone that define them, and that chart the course of their destiny.</p>\n<p>The campaign outcomes for fated quests differ from those in the Core Book. When you complete a fated quest, you have to make a choice between Honour or Glory before you claim your reward.</p>\n<p>If you choose Glory, your reward will be an artefact of power. If you choose Honour, your reward will be an exalted command trait.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exalted-command-traits\"><a href=\"#exalted-command-traits\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>EXALTED COMMAND TRAITS</h2>\n<p>Exalted command traits represent qualities so strong they come to define a warrior for the rest of their life. The first time you receive an exalted command trait, this must be given to your leader, and it replaces any existing command trait that they might have.</p>\n<p>Once your leader has been given an exalted command trait, any future exalted command traits received are discarded. Exalted command traits can never be given to a favoured warrior.</p>\n","sidebar":"rules","headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"FATED QUESTS","anchor":"#fated-quests"},{"depth":2,"value":"PATHS OPEN TO ANY WHO DARE","anchor":"#paths-open-to-any-who-dare"},{"depth":2,"value":"FATED QUEST TERRITORY RULES","anchor":"#fated-quest-territory-rules"},{"depth":2,"value":"HONOUR OR GLORY","anchor":"#honour-or-glory"},{"depth":2,"value":"EXALTED COMMAND TRAITS","anchor":"#exalted-command-traits"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
