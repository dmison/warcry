The ability can be used either before the first action or after the first or second actions made by that fighter.\n\n> Each warband has set of unique abilities on its ability card. There are also 5 universal abilities that fighters from any warband can use (see opposite). Each ability will stipulate if it requires a [double], a [triple] or a [quad].\n\n> Once a fighter has used an ability, discard the ability dice used for that ability. You can use a [triple] for an ability that requires a [double], or a [quad] for an ability that requires a [triple] or [double], but if you do so all those ability dice are discarded.\n\n> The rule for an ability may sometimes refer to the value of that ability. This refers to the score shown on the ability dice used for that ability. For example, if a player has a [double] consisting of 2 ability dice with the score of ‘5’ shown on each ability dice, the value of that ability is 5.\n\n## BONUS ACTIONS\n\n> If an ability lets a fighter make any bonus actions, these are actions in addition to the 2 actions they can carry out during an activation.\n\n## RUNEMARKS\n\n> Some abilities can only be used by fighters with certain runemarks. Any runemarks required will be shown to the left of the ability on the ability card. For example, the Inspiring Presence ability (see below) can only be used by fighters with the <Runemark mark=\"Leader\" /> runemark. The runemarks a fighter has can be found on their fighter card (pg 34).\n\n## DESPERATE LAST STAND\n\n> When all but 1 fighter in a player’s warband have been taken down(pg 44), the remaining fighter can use any number of abilities if the player activating that fighter has sufficient ability dice. This means that the fighter can use multiple abilities at each point when it would normally only be able to use 1 (for example, it can use multiple abilities before its first action, and multiple abilities again after its first or second action).\n\n## UNIVERSAL ABILITIES\n\n> | DICE | Ability | Description |\n> | :----- | :----- | :----- |\n> | [Double] | Rush | Add 1 to the Move characteristic of this fighter until the end of their activation. |\n> | [Double] | Onslaught | Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of attack actions made by this fighter that have a Range characteristic of 3 or less until the end of their activation. |\n> | [Triple] | Respite | A fighter cannot use this ability if they are within 1\" of any enemy fighters. Remove a number of damage points allocated to this fighter equal to the value of this ability. |\n> | [Triple] [LEADER] | Inspiring Presence | Pick a friendly fighter that has not activated yet this battle round and that is within 6\" of this fighter. You can activate that fighter immediately after the activation of this fighter ends. |\n> | [Quad] | Rampage |  This fighter makes a bonus move action. Then, they can make a bonus attack action. |\n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[{"book":"Warcry Core Rules","page":"40"},{"book":"ERRATA & DESIGNERS’ COMMENTARIES March 2021","page":"1"}],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"ABILITIES","anchor":"#abilities"},{"depth":2,"value":"BONUS ACTIONS","anchor":"#bonus-actions"},{"depth":2,"value":"RUNEMARKS","anchor":"#runemarks"},{"depth":2,"value":"DESPERATE LAST STAND","anchor":"#desperate-last-stand"},{"depth":2,"value":"UNIVERSAL ABILITIES","anchor":"#universal-abilities"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/openplayterrain/","title":"Open Play Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fightercards/","title":"Fighter Cards"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
