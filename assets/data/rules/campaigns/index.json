Some of these encounters are no more than brutal skirmishes, fought for territory or plunder. Others are calculated steps in a greater plan, a campaign of dominance designed to draw the eye of the Everchosen himself.\n</p>\n<cite slot=\"cite\">Warcy Core Rules</cite>\n</book-quote>\n\n## EMBARKING UPON A CAMPAIGN\n\n> To play through a campaign, you will first need to choose a campaign quest and fill out a warband roster for your warband. Once you have done so, you are ready to challenge any opponent to a campaign battle.\n\n> In Warcry, the campaign quest you choose for your warband is unique to you, and charts the progress of your warband only. This means you can challenge any opponent to a campaign battle, so long as they too have chosen a campaign quest and filled out a warband roster.\n\n> Some players may be part of a group of players that decide to all embark upon a Warcry campaign at the same time, and to only challenge those within their group to campaign battles. Other players might play a different opponent each week at their local club or games store. There is no right or wrong way to play through your campaign, and the rules presented here are flexible to cater to the needs of the individual player.\n\n\n\n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[{"book":"Warcry Core Rules","page":"63"}],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"CAMPAIGNS","anchor":"#campaigns"},{"depth":2,"value":"EMBARKING UPON A CAMPAIGN","anchor":"#embarking-upon-a-campaign"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/openplayterrain/","title":"Open Play Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
