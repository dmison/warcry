It is no easy feat to ascend to glory in these lands, but a scant few – the mightiest of all warlords – forge legends for themselves that echo throughout the ages.\n</p>\n<cite slot=\"cite\">Tomb of Champions 2019</cite>\n</book-quote>\n\n> Battles across the Eightpoints are brutal and deadly affairs, and with the following rules in play, they’re about to become a whole lot deadlier. This section introduces champion mode for your Warcry campaigns.\n\n> To play in champion mode will require all your cunning and guile, as you’ll have limited resources when creating your warband and recruiting new fighters. In addition, your fallen warriors might sustain lasting injuries, from a cracked rib that takes a few battles to fully heal to permanent blindness in one eye. However, these new risks are not without their rewards. In champion mode, you’ll be able to scour each of your dominated territories in the search for glory and treasure, plus you’ll have access to a more detailed lesser artefacts table. All in all, champion mode adds a new layer of grit and realism to your Warcry campaigns, allowing you to become fully immersed in the setting.\n\n> The following rules are used in champion mode:\n\n## EMBARKING ON A CAMPAIGN IN CHAMPION MODE\n\n> If you have created a new warband and you are embarking upon that warband’s first campaign quest, you can choose for that campaign quest to be in champion mode. If you do so, when first adding fighters to your warband roster, the combined points value of the fighters cannot exceed 1,000.\n\n> If your warband has already completed a campaign quest and you have decided to begin another, you can choose for the new campaign quest to be in champion mode. If you do so, and the previous campaign quest was not in champion mode, you must remove fighters from your warband roster until the combined points value of the fighters does not exceed 1,000. If the previous campaign quest was completed in champion mode, your warband can embark on a new campaign quest in champion mode without making any changes to the fighters on the warband roster.\n\n## ADDING FIGHTERS IN CHAMPION MODE\n\n> During the aftermath sequence of each campaign battle, if you wish to add fighters to your warband, you must consult the table below and spend the appropriate number of glory points to do so.\n\n| FIGHTER POINT VALUE | GLORY POINTS COST |\n| :-: | :-: |\n| 1-100 | 1 glory point |\n| 101-200 | 2 glory points |\n| 201-300 | 3 glory points |\n| 301+ | 4 glory points |\n\n> This applies when hiring allies (Warcry: Monsters and Mercenaries , pg 52), but does not apply when adding a monster (Warcry: Monsters and Mercenaries , pg 44-46) or when adding thralls (Core Book, pg 49) to your warband.\n\n## EXPLORING TERRITORY\n\n> In champion mode, you are able to explore your areas of dominated territory to discover what secrets and treasures they hold.\n\n> During the aftermath sequence, each time you spend 10 glory points to dominate an area of territory, you can roll on the exploration table below to see what your warriors find.\n\n### EXPLORATION TABLE\n\n| D66 | TERRITORY EXPLORATION |\n| :-: | :- |\n| 11-36 | NOTHING OF NOTE |\n| 41-43 | OLD RUINS |\n| 44-46 | CRUMBLING CATACOMBS |\n| 51-53 | RUINED TEMPLE |\n| 54-56 | DESECRATED TOMB |\n| 61-63 | CHAOTIC NEXUS |\n| 64-66 | HIDDEN STORMVAULT |\n\n### NOTHING OF NOTE\n\n> Your warriors travel far and wide across this territory but return empty-handed.\n\n> This area of dominated territory has no special rule.\n\n### OLD RUINS\n\n> A scattering of ancient ruins lie in the sun-blasted sands south of your camp. Sending your warriors scavenging amidst them does not yield much.\n\n> During the aftermath sequence of a campaign battle, when earning glory points, roll a dice for each area of dominated territory you have with this rule. For each 4+, you earn 1 additional glory point\n \n### CRUMBLING CATACOMBS\n\n> Whether the necropolis of a long-dead king or an entire underground city, these long-lost catacombs may yet yield a few secrets to those who claim them.\n\n> During the aftermath sequence of a campaign battle, before searching for lesser artefacts, roll a dice for each area of dominated territory you have with this rule. For each 4+, you can re-roll 1 dice when making a D66 search roll on the lesser artefacts table. The same dice cannot be re-rolled more than once.\n\n### RUINED TEMPLE\n\n> Atop a plateau resides an ancient temple. Before the Age of Chaos, it was a centre of power and\nwealth; bringing it under your dominion sends a stark message to those who would deny your ascent to glory.\n\n> During the aftermath sequence of a campaign battle, when earning glory points, you earn D3 additional glory points for each area of dominated territory you have with this rule. Roll separately for each.\n\n### DESECRATED TOMB\n\n> Although long stripped of its most valuable treasures, a few sealed mausoleums still reside\namidst this ancient burial ground.\n\n> During the aftermath sequence of a campaign battle, before searching for lesser artefacts, roll a dice for each area of dominated territory you have with this rule. For each 4+, you can make 1 additional roll on the lesser artefact table.\n\n### CHAOTIC NEXUS\n\n> Dark and malign powers coalesce at the heart of this territory, bringing the favour of the Dark Gods to those who claim dominance over this land.\n\n> You begin the battle with 1 additional wild dice for each area of dominated territory you have with this rule.\n\n### HIDDEN STORMVAULT\n\n> Obscured behind ancient magics since the Age of Myth, the tremors of the necroquake have revealed\nthis ancient Sigmarite vault once more. The treasures inside are yours for the taking.\n\n> You immediately receive 1 artefact of power.\n\n## CRITICAL INJURIES\n\n> In champion mode, when making injury rolls for your fighters, use the table below instead of the table in the Core Book.\n\n### INJURIES\n\n> On a roll of 14-23, your fighter sustains an injury. An injury is a rule that affects your fighter in future campaign battles. If a fighter sustains an injury, note it down on your warband roster (you can find a new warband roster for champion mode at ageofsigmar.com/warcry).\n\n> Injuries can be either `permanent` or `temporary`. If an injury is `permanent`, the fighter will have it forever (unless a lesser artefact is used to remove it). If an injury is `temporary`, at the start of the aftermath sequence of each subsequent campaign battle, roll a dice. On a 1-3, the injury persists. On a 4+, the injury is removed.\n\n> A fighter can only have one of each injury at any one time. If a fighter already has a certain injury, treat subsequent rolls of the same injury as ‘Lost Favour’ instead.\n\n> Fighters with the <Runemark mark=\"leader\" /> can only sustain `temporary` injuries. If your leader sustains an injury, do not roll a dice to see if the injury is `permanent` or `temporary`.\n\n| D66 | CRITICAL INJURY |\n| :-: | :- |\n| 11-13 | SLAIN |\n| 14 | GUT WOUND |\n| 15 | CRACKED RIB |\n| 16 | BLINDED IN ONE EYE |\n| 21 | FRACTURED ARM |\n| 22 | BROKEN LEG |\n| 23 | CONCUSSION |\n| 24-36 | LOST FAVOUR |\n| 41-65 | FULL RECOVERY |\n| 66 | SURVIVE AGAINST THE ODDS |\n\n#### SLAIN\n> This warrior’s saga has come to a sudden end\n\n> Remove this fighter from your warband roster. If they have any lesser artefacts or artefacts of power, these are lost. If this fighter has the <Runemark mark=\"leader\"/> runemark, treat this result as ‘Lost Favour’ instead.\n \n#### GUT WOUND\n\n> This warrior has sustained a brutal injury that could yet spell the end of them.\n\n> Roll a dice. On a 1, this injury is [permanent]. On a 2+, this injury is [temporary]. Halve the Wounds characteristic of this fighter (rounding up) while they have this injury.\n\n#### CRACKED RIB\n\n> Breathing is difficult for this warrior and even the lightest blow sends pain shooting through them.\n\n> Roll a dice. On a 1, this injury is [permanent]. On a 2+, this injury is [temporary]. Subtract 1 from the Toughness characteristic of this fighter (to a minimum of 1) while they have this injury.\n\n#### BLINDED IN ONE EYE\n\n> While not as outwardly crippling as some, this wound can make all the difference in the heat of battle.\n\n> Roll a dice. On a 1, this injury is [permanent]. On a 2+, this injury is [temporary]. Subtract 1 from the Attacks characteristic (to a minimum of 1) of attack actions made by this fighter while they have this injury.\n\n#### FRACTURED ARM\n\n> It is difficult to wield a blade with any great precision when your arm is cracked in three places.\n\n> Roll a dice. On a 1, this injury is [permanent]. On a 2+, this injury is [temporary]. Subtract 1 from the Strength characteristic (to a minimum of 1) of attack actions that have a Range characteristic of 3 or less made by this fighter while they have this injury.\n\n#### BROKEN LEG\n\n> Warriors with a damaged leg must move slowly but surely, rendering them easy prey for swifter foes.\n\n> Roll a dice. On a 1, this injury is [permanent]. On a 2+, this injury is [temporary]. Subtract 1 from the Move characteristic of this fighter (to a minimum of 1) while they have this injury.\n\n#### CONCUSSION\n\n> This warrior walks through the battlefield as if in\na daze, their skill at arms significantly impaired.\n\n> Roll a dice. On a 1, this injury is [permanent]. On a 2+, this injury is [temporary]. Subtract 1 from the value of abilities used by this fighter (to a minimum of 1) while they have this injury.\n\n#### LOST FAVOUR\n\n> The gods have watched this warrior’s failure with disdain.\n\n> This fighter loses 1 destiny level. If they do not have any destiny levels, they suffer no effects.\n\n#### FULL RECOVERY\n\n> This fighter suffers no effects.\n\n> This fighter suffers no effects.\n\n#### SURVIVE AGAINST THE ODDS\n\n> More than luck is behind this warrior’s survival.\n\n> Treat this result as ‘Full Recovery’. In addition, this fighter immediately gains 1 destiny level.\n\n\n## THE REWARDS OF CHAMPIONS\n\n> In champion mode, when searching for lesser artefacts, use the lesser artefacts table below instead of the table in the Core Book.\n\n> In addition to [Consumable] and [Perishable] artefacts, this table includes [Instant] artefacts. These artefacts are not given to a fighter to bear in battle. Instead, each will have an effect that is resolved immediately.\n\n| D66 | Found |\n| :-: | :- |\n| 11-16 | NOTHING BUT DUST |\n| 21 | HEALING POTION |\n| 22 | SWIFTWIND DUST |\n| 23 | SILKSTRIDER WEBBING |\n| 24 | UR-GOLD INGOT |\n| 25 | VIAL OF HEARTWOOD SAP |\n| 26 | SCROLL OF ABASOTH’S WITHERING |\n| 31 | SKIN OF FLAME-ALE |\n| 32 | JAR OF CHAMONIC GLOWFLIES |\n| 33 | CARVOLAX-SCALE ANKLET |\n| 34 | CHARM OF NINEFOLD FAVOUR |\n| 35 | HYSHIAN SWIFTFOOT SCROLL |\n| 36 | ULGUAN HEX-EIDOLON |\n| 41 | CHRONOMANTIC DIAL |\n| 42 | IRONOAK SEED |\n| 43 | GREATER HEALING POTION |\n| 44 | WANDERING SAWBONES |\n| 45 | POTION OF ONSLAUGHT |\n| 46 | ANCIENT MAP FRAGMENT |\n| 51 | GODBEAST IDOL |\n| 52 | VIAL OF JABBERSLYTHE BLOOD |\n| 53 | UR-GOLD SIGIL |\n| 54 | BLIGHT SERPENT VENOM |\n| 55 | BAUBLE OF SHADOWS |\n| 56 | FLASK OF AQUA GHYRANIS |\n| 61 | PENDANT OF BLOODGLASS |\n| 62 | RAVEN-FEATHER NECKLACE |\n| 63 | RUNE-ETCHED VAMBRACES |\n| 64 | AETHERQUARTZ PRISM |\n| 65 | LIFESTONE |\n| 66 | ASTRAL COMPASS |\n\n","sidebar":"rules","sources":[{"book":"Tome of Champions 2019","page":"78-83"}],"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"TRIAL OF CHAMPIONS","anchor":"#trial-of-champions"},{"depth":2,"value":"EMBARKING ON A CAMPAIGN IN CHAMPION MODE","anchor":"#embarking-on-a-campaign-in-champion-mode"},{"depth":2,"value":"ADDING FIGHTERS IN CHAMPION MODE","anchor":"#adding-fighters-in-champion-mode"},{"depth":2,"value":"EXPLORING TERRITORY","anchor":"#exploring-territory"},{"depth":3,"value":"EXPLORATION TABLE","anchor":"#exploration-table"},{"depth":3,"value":"NOTHING OF NOTE","anchor":"#nothing-of-note"},{"depth":3,"value":"OLD RUINS","anchor":"#old-ruins"},{"depth":3,"value":"CRUMBLING CATACOMBS","anchor":"#crumbling-catacombs"},{"depth":3,"value":"RUINED TEMPLE","anchor":"#ruined-temple"},{"depth":3,"value":"DESECRATED TOMB","anchor":"#desecrated-tomb"},{"depth":3,"value":"CHAOTIC NEXUS","anchor":"#chaotic-nexus"},{"depth":3,"value":"HIDDEN STORMVAULT","anchor":"#hidden-stormvault"},{"depth":2,"value":"CRITICAL INJURIES","anchor":"#critical-injuries"},{"depth":3,"value":"INJURIES","anchor":"#injuries"},{"depth":4,"value":"SLAIN","anchor":"#slain"},{"depth":4,"value":"GUT WOUND","anchor":"#gut-wound"},{"depth":4,"value":"CRACKED RIB","anchor":"#cracked-rib"},{"depth":4,"value":"BLINDED IN ONE EYE","anchor":"#blinded-in-one-eye"},{"depth":4,"value":"FRACTURED ARM","anchor":"#fractured-arm"},{"depth":4,"value":"BROKEN LEG","anchor":"#broken-leg"},{"depth":4,"value":"CONCUSSION","anchor":"#concussion"},{"depth":4,"value":"LOST FAVOUR","anchor":"#lost-favour"},{"depth":4,"value":"FULL RECOVERY","anchor":"#full-recovery"},{"depth":4,"value":"SURVIVE AGAINST THE ODDS","anchor":"#survive-against-the-odds"},{"depth":2,"value":"THE REWARDS OF CHAMPIONS","anchor":"#the-rewards-of-champions"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/rules/warbandroster/","title":"Warband Roster"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/waitaction/","title":"Wait"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/trialofchampions/","title":"Trial of Champions"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/thralls/","title":"Thralls"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/terrain/","title":"Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/setup/","title":"Setting up a battle"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/openplayterrain/","title":"Open Play Terrain"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/moveaction/","title":"Move"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/heroesallies/","title":"Heroes & Allies"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/monsters/","title":"Monsters"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/","title":"Home"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/lesserartefacts/","title":"Lesser Artefacts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/attackactions/","title":"Attack"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/general/","title":"General Rules"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fightercards/","title":"Fighter Cards"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/fatedquests/","title":"Fated Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/disengageaction/","title":"Disengage"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/chaoticbeasts/","title":"Chaotic Beasts"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/challengebattles/","title":"Challenge Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignbattles/","title":"Campaign Battles"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaigns/","title":"About Campaigns"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/campaignquests/","title":"Campaign Quests"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/battleround/","title":"The Battle Round"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/aftermath/","title":"Aftermath Sequence"}},{"node":{"path":"/rules/abilities/","title":"Abilities"}}]}},"context":{}}
