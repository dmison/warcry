It is no easy feat to ascend to glory in these lands, but a scant few – the mightiest of all warlords – forge legends for themselves that echo throughout the ages.</p>\n<p>Battles across the Eightpoints are brutal and deadly affairs, and with the following rules in play, they’re about to become a whole lot deadlier. This section introduces champion mode for your Warcry campaigns.</p>\n<p>]To play in champion mode will require all your cunning and guile, as you’ll have limited resources when creating your warband and recruiting new fighters. In addition, your fallen warriors might sustain lasting injuries, from a cracked rib that takes a few battles to fully heal to permanent blindness in one eye. However, these new risks are not without their rewards. In champion mode, you’ll be able to scour each of your dominated territories in the search for glory and treasure, plus you’ll have access to a more detailed lesser artefacts table. All in all, champion mode adds a new layer of grit and realism to your Warcry campaigns, allowing you to become fully immersed in the setting.</p>\n<p>The following rules are used in champion mode:</p>\n<h2 id=\"embarking-on-a-campaign-in-champion-mode\"><a href=\"#embarking-on-a-campaign-in-champion-mode\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>EMBARKING ON A CAMPAIGN IN CHAMPION MODE</h2>\n<p>If you have created a new warband and you are embarking upon that warband’s first campaign quest, you can choose for that campaign quest to be in champion mode. If you do so, when first adding fighters to your warband roster, the combined points value of the fighters cannot exceed 1,000.</p>\n<p>If your warband has already completed a campaign quest and you have decided to begin another, you can choose for the new campaign quest to be in champion mode. If you do so, and the previous campaign quest was not in champion mode, you must remove fighters from your warband roster until the combined points value of the fighters does not exceed 1,000. If the previous campaign quest was completed in champion mode, your warband can embark on a new campaign quest in champion mode without making any changes to the fighters on the warband roster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adding-fighters-in-champion-mode\"><a href=\"#adding-fighters-in-champion-mode\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>ADDING FIGHTERS IN CHAMPION MODE</h2>\n<p>During the aftermath sequence of each campaign battle, if you wish to add fighters to your warband, you must consult the table below and spend the appropriate number of glory points to do so.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">POINTS VALUE OF FIGHTER</th>\n<th align=\"center\">GLORY POINTS TO SPEND</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">1-100</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1 glory point</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">101-200</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2 glory points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">201-300</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3 glory points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">301+</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4 glory points</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This applies when hiring allies (Warcry: Monsters and Mercenaries , pg 52), but does not apply when adding a monster (Warcry: Monsters and Mercenaries , pg 44-46) or when adding thralls (Core Book, pg 49) to your warband.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploring-territory\"><a href=\"#exploring-territory\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>EXPLORING TERRITORY</h2>\n<p>In champion mode, you are able to explore your areas of dominated territory to discover what secrets and treasures they hold.</p>\n<p>During the aftermath sequence, each time you spend 10 glory points to dominate an area of territory, you can roll on the exploration table below to see what your warriors find.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exploration-table\"><a href=\"#exploration-table\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>EXPLORATION TABLE</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">D66</th>\n<th align=\"left\">TERRITORY EXPLORATION</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">11-36</td>\n<td align=\"left\">NOTHING OF NOTE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">41-43</td>\n<td align=\"left\">OLD RUINS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">44-46</td>\n<td align=\"left\">CRUMBLING CATACOMBS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">51-53</td>\n<td align=\"left\">RUINED TEMPLE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">54-56</td>\n<td align=\"left\">DESECRATED TOMB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">61-63</td>\n<td align=\"left\">CHAOTIC NEXUS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">64-66</td>\n<td align=\"left\">HIDDEN STORMVAULT</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4 id=\"nothing-of-note\"><a href=\"#nothing-of-note\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>NOTHING OF NOTE</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your warriors travel far and wide across this territory but return empty-handed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This area of dominated territory has no special rule.</p>\n<h4 id=\"old-ruins\"><a href=\"#old-ruins\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>OLD RUINS</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A scattering of ancient ruins lie in the sun-blasted sands south of your camp.
